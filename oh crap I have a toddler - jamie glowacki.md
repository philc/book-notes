* Gems
  * Boundaries help your kids feel emotionally safe. Like swaddling. Kids push on boundaries until they get a
    firm no. They are looking for the safety of clarity.
  * Before you say no, do a quick calculation of whether you will give in eventually anyway. If so, just give
    in right away and say yes. It makes you generous and a holder of your word. Don't be a hard ass all the
    time. Don't be inconsistent: saying no, but then later saying yes when pushed.

* Intro
  * Framework for progression of toddler to teen: "governing, then gardening, then guiding."
    * Parents often switch to operating in the latter two, but they don't apply until > 6 years old. A young
      child is exploring boundaries and needs governance.
  * It's the child's job to push against the boundaries and your job to hold them, and to teach consequences.
    * Reframe this from "bad" to "exciting". They're growing!
  * At 30 months, kids individuate. They stop being joyful followers of you, and start trying to figure
    themselves out.
  * Dog analogy: they're like a dog at this age. A dog takes its cue from your body language. The dog needs to
    feel that you are the alpha and that they don't need to lead. If they don't feel that, they will fill that
    role and try to lead and protect you.
    * If you're frustrated by your dog, it will show in your body language: slumped over and resentful.
      Instead feel excited and proud of your dog.

* Boundaries (chap 1)
  * Toddlers don't yet have the brain development for self control. They can't lead themselves, the parent, or
    the grandparents, so don't expect them to.
  * Physical boundaries are clearer. Everyone recognizes that dogs and kids can't navigate a parking lot by
    themselves, and so we're very firm with them in that situation. We don't plead with the child for control,
    we exert it, lovingly and kind.
  * Boundaries help your kids feel emotionally safe. Like swaddling. Kids push on boundaries until they get a
    firm no. They are looking for the safety of clarity.
  * Kids can be terrorists. "We don't negotiate with terrorists." They can't handle the power.
  * Before you say no, do a quick calculation of whether you will give in eventually anyway. If so, just give
    in right away and say yes. It makes you generous and a holder of your word. Don't be a hard ass all the
    time. Don't be inconsistent: saying no, but then later saying yes when pushed.
  * Mental and emotional boundaries are harder to define than physical.
  * All toddlers need slow transitions between activities. Rushing the morning routine because they slept in
    late is going to be a mess. That's why getting sleep right is so important.
  * Sleep is the base of the behavior pyramid. It's the first thing to diagnose when there's behavior. Kids
    who are out of control at bed time will delay their sleep, and it snowballs because they get messed up by
    their circadian rhythm.
  * Everyone in your life will be better off knowing your boundaries. Making them clear is not being mean.
    * It's much more helpful than someone with weak boundaries
      who then later copes with withdraw and resentment.

* Chapter 2 parenting philosophies
  * If you're trying to diligently follow some big parenting philosophy, you can miss the kid in front of you.
  * Attachment theory
    * The outcome you're looking for in this framework is that your kid feels attached and secure; bonded.
      They can play independently in confidence.
  * If a philosophy is not working for the family as a whole (like co-sleeping) then it's not working and
    shouldn't be forced.
  * Life shouldn't be about the kid. It isolates them from others and the community. As a counter example,
    wearing kids in a carrier is good, because you can act as you normally would, and they get to participate.
  * "My child won't let me X" should never be a lament . E.g. "won't let me focus, talk on the phone, work
    out." (what was her recommendation here?)
  * A parent who is emotionally volatile is not providing safety for their kids. Kids want boring
    predictability so they can know that their boundaries in life are reliable.
  * Styles of parental authority
    * Authoritarian: bend the child's will to an authority.
    * Authoritative: more pragmatic, balanced, respecting both the child and parent.
    * Permissive: avoid confrontation and discipline. Let the kid figure it out. Assume they have the
      capability.
      * "Govern, garden, guiding is a beautiful framework. It builds on itself. You don't want to be stuck
        governing during the kid's later years, when they're blossoming."
    * If you're guiding your preschooler, you're being too permissive. They don't want to be guided. They want
      boundaries and governance.

* Chapter 3 connection
  * True connection. Not just being there together. It's the name of the game.
  * Seeing the person, being present, loving them for who they are.
  * Cruising through bed time, or not engaging when your kid wants to show you something, is a form of
    disconnection.
  * Rewatching usually isn't connecting. Just have fun and okay.
  * Engaged rewarding. Bedtime reading usually less so because it's late and we're setting up barriers as you
    go.
  * Having them help with chores, cooking.
  * Connection activities fill your cup too because you feel like a great parent.
  * Multitasking is not connecting. Engage with your child for some concentrated time.
  * Kids need slow transitions. Consider packing their schedule less.
  * People will forget what you've said and dod, but will never forget how you made them feel.
  * "Uh huh" parenting is unconnected.

* Chapter 4 parents self care
  * Teach your kids the lesson of self care by demonstrating it. Connection trickles down from a healthy
    individual, to family, to kids.
  * Hour when the working parent gets home is when both parents need a break to transition from childcare or
    from a hard day at work. Have a nanny bathe the kids at that time so you can get a break. Go for a walk or
    play video games. Or exercise.

* Chapter 5 not enough time
  * Pareto principle: 80% of your results come from 20% of your time. Find the lower roi time and cut it,
    given you're time scarce.
  * Pick 3 big stones that you want done that day and week, and generally in your life. Focus on those. Those
    priorities shift all the time; don't focus on the smaller stuff.
  * Staying up too late is "fake productivity." Day t feels like you're being with yourself and it's self
    care, but it's ultimately draining.
  * Pick up toys, clean the kitchen, once a day. Interim cleanliness afford you no value.
  * Chunk time. Communicate in chunks. Email batch once a day; texts also. Airplane mode otherwise.

* Chapter 6 parental anxiety
  * Don't get lost in the research of how to raise your child. They move on every day and you'll lose a lot of
    time that way. And it undermines your intuition.
  * Parenting philosophies stand in the way of good parenting. Use your intuition. Feel confident.

* CHalter 8 stop edicating
  * Education and tutoring makes us miss the boat. Childhood is not a race. They need learning like patience,
    self regulation. You get a teacher voice that's above the kid and it's disconnecting.
  * Childhood is about play, especially at this age. They learn through play. Foster that and engage in that.
  * Legions, marble runs, fort building tape and scissors develop the muscles needed for writing. Tinkering;
    let them take apart old electronics; it's a precursor to engineering..
  * Free flowing artwork.
  * Often they want us to acknowledge something they've done. Or just play, and we inject some educational
    content they don't care about. It's not being present, it's brining in your agenda.
  * Sometimes we stuff them with information. It's unnatural. We're worrying about their future rather than
    being present. Let them experience.
  * Avoid taking at the child. Throwing words at them rather than conversing. How does it feel when adults do
    that to you?

* Chapter 9 executive functioning
  * Mental control and self regulation.
  * Use whiteboards to make lists for your kids so they can understand the order of things they need to do. Eg
    the morning routine. Most kids don't have this skill and get lost and it surprises us.
  * Memory games and matching games.
  * Chess.
  * Deck of cards : uno and solitaire.

* Chapter 11 cultivating creativity
  * It's going to result in innovation and problem solving. It's A gift to cultivate this in your kid.
  * Expect no set outcome. With how the picture turns out, with how the gsme unfolds.
  * Prompt your kid to tell you a weird story.

* Chapter 12 kids physical development
  * You say "be careful" 100 times while they're at the playground. They have to develop. Let them make
    mistakes.
  * "Big rough play" is the foundation for being able to sit still.
  * If you want your kid to sit still in church, give them a hard run, like you would a dog. Otherwise they
    will be sensory seeking.
  * Let them climb up the slide, play tag.
  * Don't break up fights so fast. Rough physical play has been there since the dawn of kids.
  * Home play gyms
  * It's a horrible and insidious thing to feel like your should never get hurt. Parents feel shamed. Kids
    must not be afraid to fail, parents too.
  * Instead Of saying be careful, people thrm to have their own awareness. "Do you see the poison ivy? Do you
    feel how it's slippery? How will you get down? Who will help you if you fall?"

* Chapter 13 free play
  * Let kids work their social structure out themselves. We step i. To conflict resolve, "say you're sorry!"
    But they don't mean it and don't learn that way. When they see they've hurt another kid they usually build
    empathy themselves and try to make amends. At least at the preschool age.
  * Free play is kid led play outside. Letting them play a sport is not the same. It's structured by adults.

* Chapter 14 more sleep
  * We have sleep deprived toddlers.
  * Think of it as a nutrient.
  * Always err on the side of more sleep. They need 10-13 h. No toddler is sleeping too much.
  * Good sleep chapter.
  * Do yoga or meditation to relax.
  * No screen time. They get very stimulated.
  * Routines should only be 20-30m.
  * Preempt all of the stalks. "Do you have anything you want to tell me? Do you need a sip of water?"
  * Got nightmares? Explore the source of the fears.and eliminate that stimulation.

* Chapter 15 physical bodies
  * Validate their physical feelings. Yes, and. "I hear that you're hungry. There's one hour until snack
    time."
  * Let your kid experience the cold so they can understand first hand why they need a coat.
  * Being cold will not make them more susceptible to the flu or a cold.
  * When there's an episode, address and validate their feelings before correcting their behavior.
  * Use the words settle your body rather than calm down. No one calms down when told.

* Chapter 16 discipline
  * Punishment is dealing out pain for something you don't like. They do t make the connection between their
    behavior and the pain
  * Natural consequences are a part of life. We try to prevent the natural consequences by preemptively
    punishing them.
  * Bad behavior is usually just behavior. Try on this thought: "my child isn't giving me a hard time; they're
    having a hard time."
  * Time out doesn't work. It's punishment. They don't think about what they've done.
  * Alternatives: time in (set aside to take some tome, but with you); natural consequences - leave the party,
    the grocery store. That's whT happens to adults if they have aggressive behavior. While this can be
    inconvenient it's very effective and makes you trustworthy.
  * Follow through with what you say.
  * If you're triggered, say you'll be back but what happened made you angry and you need a minute to calm
    down.
  * Don't bribe out of bad behavior.
  * Temporally, consequences need to happen right after the bad becahior. Not the next day, not later that
    day.
  * Give the toy a time out of there's bad behavior.

* Chap 17 getting the toddler to listen
  * We don't give them the time they need to listen and respond. I'll Bette not that fast yet. We talk too
    much. Over whelm them with verbal context, eg you'll be late for work. Put on your shoes. Should know this
    by. Ow.
  * Go evghem warning times to allow them to disengage with their deep play
  * Sit next o then and engage batik their voice comes into the oresent. Then tell them they can close out the
    sctivity. One more game then the iPad will take a rest!

* Chap 18 transitions
  * abrupt transitions are hard on kids.
  * 5m warning at least. Build in that time into the morning routine
  * Give specific Imsnall instructions. "We will leave the library quietly after that book. You will not have
    a fit." "When we get home, get out of the car and put your shoes near the door."
