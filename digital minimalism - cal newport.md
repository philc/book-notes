  * "More often than not, the cumulative cost of the noncrucial things we clutter our lives with can far
    outweigh the small benefits each individual piece of clutter promises." - Thoreau.
* Intro
  * People often say that digital life feels exhausting: "The issue was the overall impact of having *so many*
    different shiny baubles pulling so insistently at their attention and manipulating their mood."
  * The challenge with phones and social media is that they bring large benefits, mixed with harm.
* A lopsided arms race (chap 1)
  * "Increasingly, they dictate how we behave and how we feel, and somehow coerce us to use them more than we
    think is healthy, often at the expense of other activities we find more valuable. What's making us
    uncomfortable, in other words, is this feeling of *losing control*."
  * "The tycoons of social media have to stop pretending that they're friendly nerd gods building a better
    world nad admit they're just tobacco farmers in T-shirts selling an addictive product to children.
    Because, let's face it, checking your 'likes' is the new smoking."
  * "The attention economy drives companies like Google into a 'race to the bottom of the brain stem.'"
  * Intermittent positive reinforcement: dopamine release is stronger when the reward is intermittent. Posting
    content will produce an unknown number of likes.
  * Social media was originally about posting information for others to be able to find; it wasn't interactive
    or addictive. (Seems to argue that the like button was the genesis of the problem)
    * (For me, I remember this same dynamic when blogging -- and even earlier when frequently checking the hit
      counters on my early websites. The craving for some form of feedback).
  * We strongly crave the approval of our tribe, which is what likes on posts delivers. Unless you get no
    feedback, at which point you become distressed.
  * "you're exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology." - Sean Parker
* Digital Minimalism (chap 2)
  * Digital Minimalism: "A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number
    of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily
    miss out on everything else."
    * Contrast to maximalism, where tech with any potential benefit is worth adopting.
  * "Minimalists don't mind missing out on small things; what worries them much more is diminishing the large
    things they *already know for sure* make a good life good."
    * Well-put. This worry comes up when making decisions in software engineering, e.g. about how many
      dependencies to pull in.
  * Principles
    * Clutter is costly
      * "He asks us to treat the minutes of our life as a concrete and valuable substance -- arguably the most
        valuable substance we possess -- and to always reckon with how much of this life we trade for the
        various activities we allow to claim our time. When we confront our habits through this perspective,
        we will reach the same conclusion now that Thoreau did in his era: more often than not, the cumulative
        cost of the noncrucial things we clutter our lives with can far outweigh the small benefits each
        individual piece of clutter promises." - Thoreau.
    * Optimization is important
      * "most people's personal technology processes currently eist on the *early* part of the return curve --
        the location where additional attempts to optimize will yield massive improvements."
        * (Not me. I have the opposite problem: being tempted to optimize into the part of the curve with
          diminishing returns)
    * Intentionality is satisfying
      * (Some reflections on Amish living, and how they are very intentional about evaluating new technologies
        to see whether they undermine the Amish sense of community.)
      * "The sugar high of convenience is fleeting and the sting of missing out dulls rapidly, but the
        meaningful glow that comes from taking charge of what claims your time and attention is something that
        persists."
        * The process of selecting -- being intentional -- conveys satisfaction. I felt this way about setting
          up my first home by myself.
  * Minimalism and its benefits are not new
    * "the past couple of decades are also defined by a resurgent narrative of techno-maximalism that contends
      more is better when it comes to technology -- more connections, more information, more options."
      * (I've found this is also the case with nutrition culture: supplements, elaborate diets, all with
        likely minor benefits).
