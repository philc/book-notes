* I stopped reading this at chapter 7. It's more verbose than Bringing up Bebe, and the typeface and
  small font size choice makes this book hard to read.
* Discovering Dutchland (chap 1)
  * "Parents who prepare their children academically and hire private tutors have lost sight of the
    value of the Dutch school system, which is in favor of placing the child under minimal stress."
  * Getting entrance to a secondary school
    * "The Dutch adore lottery systems, perhaps because they rule out nepotism and favoritism. The
      Dutch are also oddly averse to meritocratic procedures. There are no interviews, and places
      are not allocated according to grades."
  * "The Dutch don't have a 'gutter press,' so even though there are real threats in the Netherlands,
    too, the threats are not blown up out of all proportion."
    * E.g. fear news about child abductions
* Mothering the mother (chap 2)
  * Dutch women typically give birth at home so the mother can be surrounded in the warmth of the
    home.
  * "The Dutch philosophy of pijn-is-fijn (pain is good): Pain is a necessary part of the process
    and helps the mother bond with her baby after birth."
  * "The Dutch approach to childbirth isn't really about having a natural, unmedicated delivery and
    embracing pain. It's about allowing a mother to feel tenacious, strong and fierce."
    * "Congrats on going Dutch."
  * "By viewing pregnancy and delivery as natural processes, they avoid the panicked, medical,
    emergency mood often found in the US and the UK."
* The real happiest babies on the block (chap 3)
  * "Can bringing up a baby who is calm and content really be that simple -- a regular routine,
    plenty of sleep, and the avoidance of overstimulation?"
  * "The Dutch are uncompromising about the sanctity of sleep. Recent research declared that the
    Dutch, on average, get more sleep than anyone else in the world -- a total of eight hours and
    twelve minutes each night."
  * "At six months, Dutch babies slept an average of two hours longer than a comparison sample of
    American babies -- fifteen hours a day in total, compared to thirteen house. *Two extra hours.*"
* Joyful illiterate preschoolers (chap 4)
  * Argues that kids will learn to read when they're ready. Pushing this milestone to be earlier
    doesn't help them in the long run -- teachers will go at the pace of the average student -- and
    it deprives the kids of unstructured play time.
  * "In Holland, very little attention is paid to whether a young child can read or write at an
    early age. In fact, there is a kind of veto on talking about it."
  * "Teaching a child to play is far more important than teaching them their alphabet and numbers."
    * Learning to speak their own mind; relate to others.
* Stress free schooling (chap 5)
  * "There are two kinds of Dutch higher education qualifications: research-orientated degrees
    offered by universities and profession-orientated degrees offered by colleges. You don't need
    specific grades to gain admission to most college programs: all you need is to pass your high
    school exams at the right level."
  * Montessori: the basic premise "help me to do it myself."
  * "Montessori thought that children should be encouraged to surf their own wave of interest."
    * (Nice image)
  * "From the age of six, one-night-away school outings are introduced."
  * "The advantage of the Dutch school system at present is that it actively keeps children in the
    race for as long as possible, as opposed to their being eliminated along the way in a
    competitive battle to the top."
* On discipline (chap 6)
  * Argues that French parents prioritize obedient, considerate children, and Dutch parents
    prioritize play and exploration. Dutch kids can come off as unruly, loud, and inconsiderate.
