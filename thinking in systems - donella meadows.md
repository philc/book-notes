* Introduction
  * Argues these problems are the symptoms of "messes". Messes result from the inherent structure of
    complex systems:
    * "Hunger, poverty, environmental degradation, economic instability, unemployment... no one
      deliberately creates those problems, no one wants them to persist, but they persist
      nonetheless."
  * "Words and sentences must, by necessity, come only one at a time in linear, logical order.
    Systems happen all at once. They are connected not just in one direction, but in many directions
    simultaneously."
    * (so pictures and graphs must be used. This book has many systems diagrams, which look like
      UML diagrams).
  * Systems theory is a complementary lens to the observant human eye, and the detail-revealing
    microscope. It's not a superior lens. "The more ways of seeing, the better."
* The basics (chap 1)
  * System: elements interconnected to achieve a function. E.g. a digestive system.
  * It's easy to see the leements of a system. It's harder to see and understand the
    interconnections -- the physical flows, or flows of information, between elements.
  * Idiom: "function" is used for nonhuman systems, "purpose" for human systems.
  * "Systems can be nested within systems. Therefore, there can be purposes within purposes."
    * E.g. "the university", which is composed of each population / stakeholder group within it.
  * Changing elements -- e.g. the players on the team -- usually has the least effect on the
    systems' behavior. Changing interconnections, and function, usually have much larger effects.
  * Stocks: foundation of a system. These are elements that are a store, a measurable quantity. The
    quantities need not be physical; "accumulated goodwill" is a stock.
  * Flows: "Stocks change over time through the action of a flow. Flows are filling and raining,
    births and deaths, purchases and sales, growth and decay, deposits and withdrawals."
  * If the sum of inflows is equal to the sum of outflows of a stock, the stock's level remains
    constant.
  * For a labor force, you can increase its rate of growth by increasing hiring (inflow), or by
    reducing churn (outflow).
  * "A stock takes time to change, because flows take time to flow. That' sa vital point, a key to
    understanding why systems behave as they do."
  * "Stocks generally change slowly, even when the flows into or out of them change suddenly.
    Therefore, stocks act as delays or buffers or shock absorbers in systems."
  * The delay in changing stocks is why it takes so long for a business to gain traction. The stocks
    of employees, customers, and word of mouth accumulate slowly.
  * Inflows and outflows are made independent when a stock is used as a buffer in the system. It
    adds stability and predictability. Oil field -> oil reserves -> gas at pump.
  * "Systems thinkers see the world as a collection of stocks along with the mechanisms for
    regulating the levels in the stocks by manipulating flows."
  * Feedback loops
    * Stabilizing loops
      * A loop which tends to keep a stock's value within a range.
      * E.g. a coffee drinker's stock of energy will be maintained at a desired level by drinking or
        avoiding caffeine.
    * Runaway loops -- reinforcing feedback
      * Also called "snowballing" feedback loops.
      * "It generates more input to a stock the more that is already there (and less input the less
        that is already there). A reinforcing feedback loop enhances whatever direction of change is
        imposed on it."
      * Self-reinforcing: stocks with exponential growth properties. They can increase a constant
        percentage of their own value, so absolute change in value keeps growing with time. Population growth,
        for example.
  * Doubling time: the time it takes for an exponentially growing stock to double in size is 70 /
    growth rate.
  * "You'll stop looking for who's to blame; instead you'll start asking, 'What's the system?' The
    concept of feedback opens up the idea that a system can cause its own behavior."
