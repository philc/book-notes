* Gems
  * Big ideas
    * Natural consequence is a better teacher than punishment
    * Descriptive praise instead of evaluative praise
    * Demonstrating that you understand the other person's feelings establishes your position as being on
      their side. With that positioning, you will be much more effective in working through their negative
      feelings with them, e.g. via problem-solving or offering choices.
  * Your attitude is what's important. If you're being patronizing or manipulative, it will come through.
  * Don't follow your empathy with "but"; it negates what you've said. Use "the problem is...".
  * Is most of your time spent asking them to do something? Is there enough time just spent being together?
  * Be on their side!
    * Instead of being on the school's side, or the sibling's side, or the other person's side, always come
      off as being on their side. Imagine you're with your very best friend. Reframe your entire thinking if
      necessary. The situation at hand is an external problem to be solved.

* Helping children deal with their feelings (chapter 1)
  * 4 strategies
    * Listen with full attention
      * As you would an adult.
    * Acknowledge them with a word: "yes", "I see".
    * Give their feelings a name
      * It makes their feelings less strange, and easier to talk about.
      * "I know how you feel" is too generic and does not show you're modeling their experience.
    * Give them their wishes in fantasy
      * E.g. "that must've hurt; I wish someone would make these doctor shots more like a massage"
  * Unhelpful ways to deal with feelings
    * Denial
    * Advice: solving the problem for them denies them the experience of wrestling with it.
    * Questioning
    * Defending the other side
    * Pity
    * Other tips
      * When they call themselves names, don't use the words back to them.
      * Your responses of empathy should have similar intensity to their emotion.
      * People object when you repeat things back exactly. It doesn't show you're processing anything.
  * Do not follow up your empathy with a "but". It negates everything that came before; it's dismissive.
    * Simple change: replace "but" with "the problem is..."
  * Denying their feelings
    * Every parent often asks their child to essentially deny their feelings. The kid says they're tired, even
      though they just had a nap, and so we try to convince them that they're not by saying "no, it's just
      that you're hungry..." This is frustrating for the child and doesn't convey respect.
    * Instead, acknowledge their feelings and empathize. It's OK if they feel differently than you do in
      situations. They're a different person.
  * Your attitude is what's important. If you're being patronizing or manipulative, it will come through.
  * Most kids can't answer why they feel as they do. Just acknowledge; no need to probe for the root cause.
  * Giving kids a physical activity to express their anger really works. The best activity the author has
    found is to ask the child to draw out their feelings, e.g. they'll scratch up the paper if they're really
    angry.
  * Exploring conflicting feelings
    * It's powerful to help children ACK and explore their conflicting feelings so they can work it out. "I
      notice you have two feelings about your brother: sometimes you like having him around because he's fun
      and you like to take care of him, and other times you just wish he was gone."
  * Writing down their wish list
    * A toddler was passing by a gift store who wants to buy everything in it. One way she found to satisfy
      them is to ask them what they want, and take out a pencil and write it down with them. In writing down
      their wish list, it shows that you're taking their desire seriously enough to write it down. It doesn't
      mean you have to buy these things; it's enough to show you understand their desire.

* Getting Cooperation (chapter 2)
  * Technique 1: Describe your observations
    * If you say something hasn't been done, and the child is at fault, it's hard for the child to concentrate
      because they're feeling attacked. Instead, just describe clearly what hasn't been done, or the dynamic
      you're seeing. For instance, "I see the dog is pacing around the house and really has to go to the
      bathroom."
    * "How many times have I told you to turn off the light?" => "I see the bathroom light is still on."
  * Technique 2: Give information
    * It's much easier to take information than an accusation. Often, when kids get the information, they can
      then interpolate what needs to be done.
    * "Who left the milk out? That's irresponsible." => "The milk has been left out and it's going to spoil."
    * "Walls are not for writing on. Paper is for writing on."
    * Avoid giving your child information they already know; it comes off as patronizing.
  * Technique 3: Say it with a word
    * Kids get tired of lectures. A single word command can be refreshing to both you and the kid.
    * "Dog!" (dog needs to go out)
    * Teenagers in particular seem to find this style refreshing.
  * Technique 4: Talk about your feelings
    * It's genuine and non-confrontational to talk about your own feelings. It's not an accusation against
      others.
    * It's a healthy dynamic if kids can understand how you feel, and want to make you feel better.
    * "It hurts my feelings when my room is messy and was made messy by other people."
    * "I feel frustrated when I start to say something, and I can't finish."
  * Technique 5: write a note
    * Sometimes it's easier to convey a point if there's some distance between you and the listener.
    * Idea: parents put a sign outside of their room saying whether they are ready for the kids to come in.
      One side: "shush we're sleeping", reverse: "hey, come on it. Love mom & dad."
    * Idea: "a note on the TV which says "Think: before turning this on, have I done my homework?"
  * If you don't get through to the child, just transform the message by employing one of the other
    techniques.
  * Attitudes in your message:
    * Children thrive when you convey "you're basically a capable loving person and once you're alerted to the
      issue, you'll resolve it."
    * A poisonous attitude says "you're not doing anything right, and this current example is the latest proof
      of that."
  * Be careful of "please" in intense situations. If you really want something to happen, don't soften it with
    please.

* Alternatives to punishment (chapter 3)
  * Punishment
    * The author argues this does not work: it distracts the child from the issue, and deprives them of the
      feeling of remorse.
    * Natural consequences are better teachers than punishment.
      * Natural consequence: people's natural reactions to their behavior. E.g. "I won't want to lend you
        clothes if you mess them up before returning"; the parent not wanting to play anymore because the kid
        isn't being nice; parent doesn't want to bring the child to the grocery store because they don't
        behave.
      * Punishment is actively and intentionally depriving someone of privileges which are usually not even
        related to the bad behavior. E.g. "no TV tonight if you don't sit still during church."
  * Prevention is very effective, better than reactive solutions. E.g. to prevent your kid from misbehaving in
    the grocery store, beforehand, draw two people in a grocery store and role play.
  * "Problem solve" it together
    * Before entering a problem-solving exercise with anyone, psyche yourself up to be listening, open minded,
      non-judgmental, and collaborative.
    * The general goal is to make it feel like a collaboration to partner in the solution, rather than making
      them feel like they are the problem and you are cursing them to change themselves. Just brainstorming
      ideas, writing them down, and discussing them makes both of you in tune with the other's needs.
  * Is most of your time spent asking them to do something? Is there enough time just spent being together?
  * When giving them "choice" in the matter, they can seem like false choices or veiled threats. If you really
    want to introduce choice into the situation to allow your child some autonomy, allow them to come up with
    options, and pick one themselves.
  * Timeouts
    * Instead of separation, a misbehaving child needs more close time with a listening parent, who can say
      it's not acceptable, and brainstorm alternatives with the kid.
    * "I know you get mad when your sister pulls your arms. How can we let her know this, without hitting
      her?"

* Encouraging autonomy (chapter 4)
  * One of the most important things we can do as parents is encouraging their own autonomy. They cannot be
    protected by us their entire lives. They need to be given space to make their own decisions, mistakes, and
    solutions.
  * Show respect for their struggles. Offer advice before actually opening the jar for them. Don't rush in to
    tie their shoes.
  * When children ask questions, help them explore the answer for themselves. Don't jump in with answers. "Why
    does grandma visit so often?" Replay the question and see what they think. See yourself as a sounding
    board.
  * If you weigh in on every detail of their life, then every step of the way, there's a contest of wills
    between your judgement and theirs.
  * On giving advice
    * First let the child develop their own thoughts about the situation. Then offer yours. They will be in a
      better frame of mind to receive your advice.
  * Share your own values as the backdrop of advice, or in place of advice.
    * E.g. "Dad, do I have to go the my friend's birthday party?": "I think it's important to attend the
      birthdays of your very best friends, even if it's inconvenient."
  * Anecdote: one mother used to have fights about clothing with her daughter every day. They problem-solved
    together, and now the kid can wear whatever they want on the weekend, and on school days, the mother puts
    out 2 outfits and the daughter picks one.
  * Having kids write even basic goals for themselves (sports, academics) is very powerful. It seems so
    grow-up and serious. Writing things down is much more powerful than just talking about it. You can even
    ask kids to write down a schedule and figure out how they're going to make time for the things they want
    to do.
  * Don't take hope away by protecting them from disappointment: don't say "it's very unlikely you can be a
    pro basketball team so aim lower."

* Praise (chapter 5)
  * The impact of praise
    * Children who feel good about their abilities will gladly accept new challenges when they come. They'll
      raise their hand in school when there's a new challenge.
    * Kids who are belittled all the time at home, and who are spoken to as if they're incompetent robots,
      will shrink from challenges. They will not raise their hands.
  * Dangers of praise
    * Praising work that the recipient knows is not good, or which was trivial, will make them doubt the
      judgement and sincerity of the praise giver.
    * Praise can create anxiety if they feel like they'll have to achieve a perfect performance next time to
      receive the same type of praise. "The pressure is on."
  * Descriptive praise vs. evaluative praise
    * Descriptive praise: describe what you see or how you've been made to feel in specifics, and leave the
      actual valuation out of it.
      * Your child, once they hear how they made you feel, will praise themselves.
    * Examples
      * "this painting makes me feel like I'm on a warm summer day in the forest. How did you come up with
        that?" The child will think "I'm a great painter, and he likes it."
      * "I noticed the plants are dry, and that you watered them even though it's not your job. That shows
        initiative."
      * "I see someone put their shoes on all by themselves. Now that's what I call being helpful."
    * Why it works
      * It's more self-evidently genuine, because you have to express detailed observations about the work
        when conveying the praise. You can't just say "it's good" and then look away. It shows "proof of
        work."
    * Praising effort vs. results
      * Praise the level of effort instead of the result. Showing that you recognize the effort demonstrates
        that you understand what the person went through to get the accomplishment. Also, applying effort is
        generally a much more robust goal than achieving specific outcomes, because effort is what the person
        can control; so praise effort.
    * The emphasis of the praise should be on them, not you
      * "I am so proud of you because of X" actually diminishes the accomplishment, because it's shifted the
        focus from their achievement to your pride.
      * "I knew you could do it" is giving credit to your foresight, not their accomplishment.
      * Instead, focus on how big of accomplishment it is, and the effort involved. "You must be so proud of
        yourself; this was only possible with months and months of hard work and diligent preparation."
  * Do not praise by comparison
    * It puts relationships (siblings, close friends, classmates) in a weird, competitive light
    * "Oh you've tied your shoes all by yourself; your little brother can't do that."
    * "You cleaned up your room! Your older sister never does that."
    * If they're the best one in a recital, just tell them that they played well, and everybody was into it,
      and it sounded like real music. You don't need to say that they were the best one. They should be
      focusing on the outcome they want, and their own performance. Not how they stack up against the other
      kids.

* Freeing children from roles (chapter 6)
  * Avoid giving your kids a label or role ("he's a troublemaker", "she always has to be the boss") because
    your perceptions will inevitably reinforce it in your mind, and if the child hears it, they will accept it
    and live up to it.
  * Even favorable roles are dangerous, e.g. "she brings me so much joy", because they may feel like they
    always need to be on their best behavior to live up to that role, and misrepresent their true feelings if
    they ever get angry our burnt out.
  * Give them the freedom to be who they want to be and not get crushed or burnt out by the high standard you
    set for them.

* Putting it all together (chapter 7)
  * (A fun set of examples about a parent trying to handle their princess-like child, where they used skills
    from this book to handle her negative feelings).
  * If you're going to offer a choice, it helps to first respect their negative feelings. "I can see how much
    you don't like this medicine... would you like it with juice or ginger ale?"
    * Establish your position as being on their side, so the choices offered don't feel manipulative.
  * Idea: make cleanup into a game. "Finish cleaning up these toys before the song ends!"
  * Idea: fun choice: "walk to bed, or hop to bed?"
  * Be on their side!
    * Instead of being on the school's side, or the sibling's side, or the other person's side, always come
      off as being on their side. Imagine you're with your very best friend. Reframe your entire thinking if
      necessary. The situation at hand is an external problem to be solved.

* Misc tips (appendix)
  * Asking kids questions about their lives
    * Parents want to ask lots of questions of their kids when there's something they want to know about. For
      instance, "how was the overnight camping trip with your classmates?" If you ask, kids get annoyed and
      clam up. If you don't ask, you may feel like you're not showing interest or showing that you care. An
      alternative is to give an invitation to talk: "I love to hear about how your trip went when you're ready
      to tell me, or if you'd like to tell me."
  * In times of need, consider building the person up rather than tearing them down. For instance if your kid
    loses their cell phone, consider praising how long they kept the cell phone in their possession, and let
    them naturally brainstorm how they're going to keep it from being lost again in the future, and take pride
    in their ownership. Similar scenario: when they get a bad grade.
  * Rather than putting a kid in a role -- "they're picky eater", "they're shy", "they're slow to warm up to
    new things" as a defense towards other adults as to why your kid is not engaging with them, instead use
    the phrase "when they're ready". This seems to satisfy everybody's concern that the kid isn't engaging in
    the way they expect.
  * Competitive games
    * They're hard for any age. If you're going to play board games like Candy Land, then the person who
      completes the board first can be in first place, but let everybody else complete the game.
    * Kids love races. A way to make them noncompetitive is to buy a stopwatch, have one kid race, and the
      other kid time then and then have them switch, and then have them try to beat their own times. You might
      think they would directly compare, but they don't enough to ruin the fun. They focus on beating their
      own times.
