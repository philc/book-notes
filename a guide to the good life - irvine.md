* Gems
  * If a contemptible person insults you, it can be ignored. Maybe even find comfort in that, if they're upset
    with you, you must be doing the right thing.
  * Seneca: old age is full of delights and should be cherished. We graduate out of many vices and appetites;
    we live with the full benefit of our years of wisdom.
  * "Someone who thinks he will live forever is far more likely to waste his days than someone who fully
    understands that his days are numbered."
* Intro
  * "A grand goal in living is the first component of a philosophy of life. This means that if you lack a
    grand goal in living, you lack a coherent philosophy of life."
    * The most important thing you want "out" of life.
* The first stoics (chap 2)
  * "The Stoics enjoyed whatever "good things" happened to be available, but even as they did so, they
    prepared themselves to give up the things in question."
    * In contrast to the asceticism of the Cynics.
  * Stoic virtue, which leads to a well-lived life.
    * "In the same way that a 'virtuous' (or excellent) hammer is one that performs well the function for
      which it was designed -- namely, to drive nails -- a virtuous individual is one who performs well the
      function for which humans were designed. To be virtuous, then, is to live as we were designed to live;
      it is to live, as Zeno put it, in accordance with nature. The stoics would add that if we do this, we
      will have a good life."
      * Cultivate the Earth, honor and take care of others, be rational.
  * Later the Roman stoics emphasized tranquility as the desirable by-product of pursuing virtue, and made
    tranquility the ultimate goal.
  * "By pointing to the tranquility people would gain by pursuing virtue -- they would make Stoic doctrines
    more attractive to ordinary Romans."
* Roman Stoicism (chap 3)
  * Compared to the deep joy of living virtuously, with content, and self-reliance, "pleasures of the flesh
    are 'paltry and trivial and fleeting.'"
  * Pairing life-philosophy with religion
    * "Epictetus would then tell the prospective student that if he wishes to have a good life, he must
      consider his nature and the purpose for which God created him and live accordingly."
  * "According to Marcus, it was Apollonius who impressed on him the need to be decisive and reasonable,
    taught him how to combine days full of intense activity with periods of relaxation, and taught him how,
    'with the same unaltered composure,' to withstand sickness and pain."
* Negative visualization (chap 4)
  * "Misfortune weighs most heavily on those who 'expect nothing but good fortune.'"
  * Hedonic adaptation
    * "We humans are unhappy in large part because we are insatiable; after working hard to get what we want
      we routinely lose interest in the object of our desire. Rather than feeling satisfied, we feel a bit
      bored, and in response to this boredom, we go on to form new, even grander desires."
    * This adaptation happens as our wealth increases, we accumulate nicer belongings, and as we marry. We
      take it for granted. The antidote is negative visualization.
    * This adaptation has the power to extinguish our enjoyment of the world.
    * "Satisfaction treadmill"
      * "There are doubtless many thing sin our life to which we have adapted, things that we once dreamed of
        having but that we now take for granted, including, perhaps, our spouse, our children, our house, our
        car, and our job."
    * "The easiest way for us to gain happiness is to learn how to want the things we already have."
    * "One reason children are capable of joy is because they take almost nothing for granted. To them, the
      world is wonderfully new and surprising."
  * Negative visualization
    * Seneca says "she should remember that all we have is 'on loan' from Fortune, which can reclaim it
      without our permission -- indeed, without even advanced notice." (including our dear ones).
    * Vividly picture yourself without all the things, your kids, etc. This elevates your appreciation and
      will make us more attentive.
    * It's a technique for promoting optimism. Appreciate the marvels that we have and the age that we live
      in.
  * "Epictetus counsels that when we say good-bye to a friend, we should silently remind ourselves that this
    might be our final parting. If we do this, we will be less likely to take our friends for granted, and as
    a result, we will probably derive far more pleasure from friendships than we otherwise would."
  * Most of us spend time thinking about the things we don't yet have. "We would be much better off, Marcus
    says, to spend this time thinking of all the things we have and reflecting on how much we would miss them
    if they were not ours." Or how we would feel if we lost our freedom.
  * "Contemplating our own death can dramatically enhance our enjoyment of life."
  * Catastrophes
    * A catastrophe has great value in that it can blast people out of their jadedness. Ironically, those who
      have experienced hardship are more joyful than those who haven't.
    * Negative visualization, in contrast to catastrophes:
      * We don't have to wait to engage in negative visualization the way we have to wait to be struck by a
        catastrophe.
      * Being struck by a catastrophe can easily kill us; engaging in negative visualization can't.
      * Because negative visualization can be done repeatedly, its beneficial effects, unlike those of a
        catastrophe, can last indefinitely.
  * Saying grace before a meal can be a form of negative visualization. Transform an ordinary meal into a
    cause for celebration.
  * Proud adults who look down on people who are satisfied. Argues that drive is not worth having if it comes
    at the expense of satisfaction.
    * "They have somehow gotten the idea that by refusing to take delight in the world, they are demonstrating
      their emotional maturity: to take delight in things, they think, is childish."
  * "Enjoy and appreciate what you have without clinging to it."
    * "At the same time as the practice of negative visualization is helping us appreciate the world, it is
      preparing us for changes in that world. To practice negative visualization, after all, is to contemplate
      the impermanence of the world around us."
  * Periodically contemplating the impermanence of life, and recognizing that some things we do will be the
    last time we do them. E.g. walking the halls of our high school. Eating at a favorite restaurant before it
    closes down.
    * "Previously, when we thought we could repeat them at will, a meal at this restaurant or a kiss shared
      with our lover might have been unremarkable. But now that we know they cannot be repeated, they will
      likely become extraordinary events: the meal will be the best we ever had at the restaurant, and he
      parting kiss will be one of the most intensely bittersweet experiences life has to offer."
    * "By contemplating the impermanence of everything in this world, we are forced to recognize that every
      time we do something could be the last time we do it, and this recognition can invest the things we do
      with a significance and intensity that would otherwise be absent. We will no longer sleepwalk through
      our life.
* The dichotomy of control (chap 5)
  * Summary
    * Save a ton of mental bandwidth and anguish by identifying the things you worry about, over which you
      have no control, and stop worrying about them.
    * For the rest, set internal goals about your inputs, because you can control your inputs, your values,
      and character.
  * Set internal, not external goals.
    * One cannot fully control whether he wins the tennis match, but can control his internal goals, and
      inputs: play the best game possible given his current abilities.
    * "what better way is there to win a tennis match than by playing to the best of your ability? The Stoics
      realized that our internal goals will affect our external performance, but they also realized that the
      goals we consciously set for ourselves can have a dramatic impact on our subsequent emotional state."
      (So set your goal to play your best game, not to win, and let that goal naturally carry you to victory).
  * Rather than a goal of having my spouse love me, a related internal goal is to "behave in a lovable
    manner."
  * Reducing the sting of getting a manuscript rejected: "she should have as her goal not something external
    over which she has little control, such as getting her novel published, but something internal over which
    she has considerable control, such as how hard she works on the manuscript or how many times she submits
    it in a given period of time."
  * Internalizing one's goal to do one's best to change society is the only way to remain tranquil while
    participating in civil affairs and politics (because so little is under your control).
* Fatalism (chap 6)
  * "We must learn to welcome whatever falls to our lot and persuade ourselves that whatever happens to us is
    for the best. Indeed, according to Marcus, a good man will welcome 'every experience the looms of fate may
    weave for him.'"
    * "The fates" write the play, in which we are the actors.
  * "We can either spend this moment wishing it could be different, or we can embrace this moment. If we
    habitually do the former, we will spend much of our life in a state of dissatisfaction; if we habitually
    do the latter, we will enjoy our life. This, I think, is why the Stoics recommend that we be fatalistic
    with respect to the present."
  * (What's being described is like a form of negative visualization: rather than thinking about how our
    situation could be worse, so that we can enjoy it more, refuse to think about how it could be better, so
    we can remain present, and enjoy it.)
* Self-denial (chap 7)
  * "Voluntary discomfort"
    * Consider pretending that bad things have happened, and deprived you of your comforts, to appreciate more
      what you have. "Practicing poverty".
    * Like living in a cold climate for a season to appreciate your warm climate home.
  * Benefits
    * A form of training, to prepare the body and mind
      * "We harden ourselves against misfortunes that might befall us in the future.
    * Reduce anxiety about future calamities, after voluntarily experiencing minor ones
    * Appreciate what we already have
  * In addition to voluntary discomfort, Stoics advised periodically foregoing pleasure. Develop the muscle of
    self-control. Allows us to be able to focus and not be distracted by temptations.
  * "This self-control make sit far more likely that they will attain the goals of their philosophy of life,
    and this in turn dramatically increases their chances of living a good life."
  * Abstaining from pleasure can itself be a pleasure
    * "If you refrain from eating the ice cream, you will forgo this gastronomic pleasure but will experience
      pleasure of a different kind: As Epictetus observes, you will 'be pleased and will praise yourself' for
      not eating it."
    * "If we weighed the costs and benefits of eating it against the costs of not eating it -- we might find
      that the sensible thing for us to do, if we wish to maximize our pleasure, is not eat it."
* Meditation (chap 8)
  * Western meditation is very different from Eastern meditation. Rather than an emptying of the mind, it's
    a period of active inquiry.
  * "Self-review of daily living."
    * To help us advance our practice of Stoicism, Seneca advises that we periodically meditate on the events
      of daily living, how we responded to these events, and how, in accordance with Stoic principles we
      should have responded to them."
  * Seneca: "His advice to himself: when contemplating whether to criticize someone, he should consider not
    only whether the criticism is valid but also whether the person can stand to be criticized. He adds that
    the worse a man is, the less likely he is to accept constructive criticism."
  * "Seneca's conclusion: if you are going to publish, you must be willing to tolerate criticism." Just don't
    take it heart.
  * "We should likewise be careful observers of the actions of other people. We can, after all, learn from
    their mistakes and their successes." (As case studies).
  * Becoming less sensitive to external inputs when practicing stoicism.
    * "We will shrug off their insults and slights. We will also shrug off any praise they might direct our
      way."
* Duty (chap 9)
  * We usually seek the approval of other people -- to appear good in their eyes -- and this creates a lot of
    work in us to come off well, and the outcome isn't really in our control. This will disrupt our
    tranquility.
  * Marcus said "fellowship is the purpose behind our creation." Fulfilling our purpose requires being social;
    it's our social duty.
  * Marcus did not think very highly of humanity: "Marcus suggests that when we know our death is at hand, we
    can ease our anguish on leaving this world by taking a moment to reflect on all the annoying people we
    will no longer have to deal with when we are gone."
  * Marcus concluded that doing his social duty was the best chance at having a good life. There's a certain
    kind of delight that comes from fulfilling one's purpose, and doing good.
* Social relations (chap 10)
  * Be selective of our friends; corrupted values and vices are contagious. Avoid those who are whiners and
    complainers; they destroy tranquility.
  * When annoyed by people: empathize -- no doubt we annoy others at times. And being annoyed makes the whole
    experience worse for us -- it only hurts us. (Is this true? If we successfully correct the person who's
    being annoying, that helps everyone, and it's an act of kindness towards them).
  * It's wasted -- and negative -- energy to speculate about what an annoying person is thinking.
    * "We can also, Marcus suggests, lessen the negative impact other people have on our life by controlling
      our thoughts about them."
  * "People, Marcus reminds us, do not choose to have the faults they do. Consequently, there is a sense in
    which the people who annoy us cannot help doing so."
    * (No, this is too generous. Many faults should be diminished if not for malice and pride, or selfishness,
      each of which shouldn't be simply looked over as intrinsic, imutable qualities, to be forgiven and
      forgotten.)
  * "Social fatalism" -- Marcus is resigned to accept people as they come.
    * "Even though it is possible to change others, we can take some of the agony out of dealing with them by
      telling ourselves that they are fated to behave as they do."
  * "He adds that if we detect anger and hatred within us and wish to seek revenge, one of the best forms of
    revenge on another person is to refuse to be like him." (fun)
  * "It is easy these days to find people who will agree that their life would have gone better if they had
    shown more sexual reserve; it is hard to find people who think their life would have gone better if they
    had shown less."
    * (OK; how "sexually reserved" should one be?)
* Insults (chap 11)
  * Insults can be intensely painful, because they affect our pride and identity, and can be remembered long
    after they've occurred, upsetting our tranquility.
  * "One of their sting-elimination strategies is to pause, when insulted, to consider whether what the
    insulter said is true. If it is, there is little reason to be upset."
    * "Why is it an insult to be told what is self-evident?"
  * "As we make progress in our practice of Stoicism, we will become increasingly indifferent to other
    people's opinions of us."
  * "Indeed, a Stoic sage, were one to exist, would probably take the insults of his fellow humans to be like
    the barking of a dog."
  * If a contemptible person insults you, it can be ignored. Maybe even find comfort in that, if they're upset
    with you, you must be doing the right thing.
  * The voicing of an insult doesn't intrinsically carry a string -- the harm only occurs if we let it, bu
    judging the words as harmful and then reacting negatively to them.
  * How to respond to insults? With humor (particularly self-deprecating humor), or with no response at all --
    with a magnanimous air. A non-response robs the insulter of the pleasure of having upset us and seeing
    that effect.
  * Some insults require a vigorous response, if they are likely to encourage more insults. Like checking a
    disruptive student in class. Correct them as you would a child, with the intention of teaching them.
* Grief (chap 12)
  * The goal is not to silence grief; doing so would not honor the affection we have for the lost life. The
    goal is to avoid being excessively grief-stricken.
  * Negative visualization helps anticipate and remove the shock of losing a loved one.
  * "Retrospective negative visualization" is comparing the time that we got with a person to having had no
    time at all. In doing so, we can be thankful of the time we had.
  * (some of the material in this chapter doesn't sound like a healthy approach -- "overcoming grief with
    reason")
* Anger (chap 13)
  * Seneca argues that anger is an unhelpful emotion, too damaging to be worth its benefits.
  * Being overly sensitive makes one susceptible to anger. Harden yourself by avoiding too much comfort, and
    experiencing conflict often.
  * Marcus: consider one's angry moments over offenses. What cosmic insignificance those offenses are.
    * "(Marcus) reflects on the times, almost a century earlier, of Emperor Vespasian. People everywhere were
      doing the usual things: marryaing, raising children, farming, loving, envying, fighting, and feasting.
      But, he points out, 'of all that life, not a trace survives today.'"
  * It will combat our anger to remember that we are all sinners and worthy of anger. We are no different than
    the next man.
  * If you do lash out, apologizing is very calming and helps us look past the original offense. And it feels
    good to show a high quality character.
  * Seneca: instead of being angry, "why not make yourself a person to be loved by all while you live and
    missed when you have made your departure?"
* Personal values - on seeking fame (chap 14)
  * Optimizing for popularity leads to being enslaved by others. Popularity is not something we fully control.
    * "Stoics value their freedom, and they are therefore reluctant to do anything that will give others power
      over them. But if we seek social status, we give other people power of us: We have todo things alculated
      to make them admire us, and we have to refrain from doing things that will trigger their disfavor.
      Epictetus therefore advises us not to seek social status, since if we make it our goal to please others,
      we will no longer be free to please ourselves. We will, he says, have enslaved ourselves."
  * The foolish desire for "immortal fame"
    * "Think about how foolish it is to want to be rememberred after we die. For one thing, since we are dead,
      we will not be able to enjoy our fame. For another, we are foolish to think that future generations will
      praise us, without even having met us, when we find it so difficult to praise our contemporaries, even
      though we meet them routinely. Instead of thinking about future fame, Marcus says, we would do well to
      concern ourselves with our present situation; we should "make the best of today."
  * Sometimes even your friend won't root for you to succeed, because if you do, it will make them
    uncomfortable.
* Personal values - on luxurious living (chap 15)
  * If one becomes unable to enjoy "anything but the best", it's a state worthy of pity. It is more of an
    achievement to be able to find delight in the most primitive things.
  * Increasingly discerning tastes is a curse.
    * "People who achieve luxurious lifestyles are rarely satisfied: experiencing luxury only whets their
      appetite for even more luxury."
  * Musonious: eat for nourishment, and favor foods that require little prep.
  * "Life's necessities are cheap and easily obtainable. Those who crave luxury typically have to spend
    considerable time and energy to attain [and maintain] it; those who eschew luxury can devote this same
    time and energy to other, more worthwhile undertakings."
  * Stoicism calls for plain living, but not for poverty. A luxurious lifestyle has the danger of
    compromising our character and consuming our attention.
* Exile (chap 16)
  * "It may be true, says Seneca, that by being exiled he has been deprived of his country, his friends and
    family, and his property, but he has taken with him into exile the things that matter most: his place in
    Nature and his virtue."
  * Exile is just a "change of location."
  * "Diogenes, with typical Cynic wit, responded that although it was true that the people of Sinope had
    sentenced him to exile, he in turn had sentenced them to remain in Sinope."
  * Exile has helped some -- by curtailing their pace of luxurious living, and by causing some to become
    philosophers.
* Old age (chap 17)
  * "A twenty-year old might reject Stoicism in the belief that the world is going to be her oyster; an
    eighty-year-old knows full well that the world isn't her oyster and that her situation is only going to
    worsen with teh passing years. Although she may have believed she was immortal when she was tenty, her own
    mortality is now painfully obvious to her. Facedw ith death, she might finally be willing to settle for
    'mere tranquility', and she might, as a result, be ripe for stoicism."
    * 80/20 inverse. What a difference 60 years makes...
  * Seneca: old age is full of delights and should be cherished. We graduate out of many vices and appetites;
    we live with the full benefit of our years of wisdom.
    * (What a great framing)
  * Using our knowledge of our proximity to death to our advantage:
    * "In our youth, because we assumed that we would live forever, we took our days for granted and as a
      result wasted many of them. In our old age, however, waking up each morning cna be a cause for
      celebration. As Seneca notes, 'If God is pleased to add another day, we should welcome it with glad
      hearts.' And after celebrating having been given another day to live, we can fill that day with
      appreciative living."
* Dying (chap 18)
  * "Someone who thinks he will live forever is far more likely to waste his days than someone who fully
    understands that his days are numbered."
* On becoming a Stoic (chap 19)
  * "Musonious observes that the time and energy people expend on illicit love affairs far outweighs the time
    and energy it would take them, as practicing Stoics, to develop the self-control required to avoid such
    affairs."
  * Having a philosophy of life reduces the effort required to make life's decisions
    * "It is, after all, hard to know what to choose when you aren't really sure what you want."
  * The reward for practicing Stoicism is the ability to frequently take delight in the world around us.
