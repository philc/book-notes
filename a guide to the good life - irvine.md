* Intro
  * "A grand goal in living is the first component of a philosophy of life. This means that if you lack a
    grand goal in living, you lack a coherent philosophy of life."
    * The most important thing you want "out" of life.
* The first stoics (chap 2)
  * "The Stoics enjoyed whatever "good things" happened to be available, but even as they did so, they
    prepared themselves to give up the things in question."
    * In contrast to the asceticism of the Cynics.
  * Stoic virtue, which leads to a well-lived life.
    * "In the same way that a 'virtuous' (or excellent) hammer is one that performs well the function for
      which it was designed -- namely, to drive nails -- a virtuous individual is one who performs well the
      function for which humans were designed. To be virtuous, then, is to live as we were designed to live;
      it is to live, as Zeno put it, in accordance with nature. The stoics would add that if we do this, we
      will have a good life."
      * Cultivate the Earth, honor and take care of others, be rational.
  * Later the Roman stoics emphasized tranquility as the desirable by-product of pursuing virtue, and made
    tranquility the ultimate goal.
  * "By pointing to the tranquility people would gain by pursuing virtue -- they would make Stoic doctrines
    more attractive to ordinary Romans."
* Roman Stoicism (chap 3)
  * Compared to the deep joy of living virtuously, with content, and self-reliance, "pleasures of the flesh
    are 'paltry and trivial and fleeting.'"
  * Pairing life-philosophy with religion
    * "Epictetus would then tell the prospective student that if he wishes to have a good life, he must
      consider his nature and the purpose for which God created him and live accordingly."
  * "According to Marcus, it was Apollonius who impressed on him the need to be decisive and reasonable,
    taught him how to combine days full of intense activity with periods of relaxation, and taught him how,
    'with the same unaltered composure,' to withstand sickness and pain."
* Negative visualization (chap 4)
  * "Misfortune weighs most heavily on those who 'expect nothing but good fortune.'"
  * Hedonic adaptation
    * "We humans are unhappy in large part because we are insatiable; after working hard to get what we want
      we routinely lose interest in the object of our desire. Rather than feeling satisfied, we feel a bit
      bored, and in response to this boredom, we go on to form new, even grander desires."
    * This adaptation happens as our wealth increases, we accumulate nicer belongings, and as we marry. We
      take it for granted. The antidote is negative visualization.
    * This adaptation has the power to extinguish our enjoyment of the world.
    * "Satisfaction treadmill"
      * "There are doubtless many thing sin our life to which we have adapted, things that we once dreamed of
        having but that we now take for granted, including, perhaps, our spouse, our children, our house, our
        car, and our job."
    * "The easiest way for us to gain happiness is to learn how to want the things we already have."
    * "One reason children are capable of joy is because they take almost nothing for granted. To them, the
      world is wonderfully new and surprising."
  * Negative visualization
    * Seneca says "she should remember that all we have is 'on loan' from Fortune, which can reclaim it
      without our permission -- indeed, without even advanced notice." (including our dear ones).
    * Vividly picture yourself without all the things, your kids, etc. This elevates your appreciation and
      will make us more attentive.
    * It's a technique for promoting optimism. Appreciate the marvels that we have and the age that we live
      in.
  * "Epictetus counsels that when we say good-bye to a friend, we should silently remind ourselves that this
    might be our final parting. If we do this, we will be less likely to take our friends for granted, and as
    a result, we will probably derive far more pleasure from friendships than we otherwise would."
  * Most of us spend time thinking about the things we don't yet have. "We would be much better off, Marcus
    says, to spend this time thinking of all the things we have and reflecting on how much we would miss them
    if they were not ours." Or how we would feel if we lost our freedom.
  * "Contemplating our own death can dramatically enhance our enjoyment of life."
  * Catastrophes
    * A catastrophe has great value in that it can blast people out of their jadedness. Ironically, those who
      have experienced hardship are more joyful than those who haven't.
    * Negative visualization, in contrast to catastrophes:
      * We don't have to wait to engage in negative visualization the way we have to wait to be struck by a
        catastrophe.
      * Being struck by a catastrophe can easily kill us; engaging in negative visualization can't.
      * Because negative visualization can be done repeatedly, its beneficial effects, unlike those of a
        catastrophe, can last indefinitely.
  * Saying grace before a meal can be a form of negative visualization. Transform an ordinary meal into a
    cause for celebration.
  * Proud adults who look down on people who are satisfied. Argues that drive is not worth having if it comes
    at the expense of satisfaction.
    * "They have somehow gotten the idea that by refusing to take delight in the world, they are demonstrating
      their emotional maturity: to take delight in things, they think, is childish."
  * "Enjoy and appreciate what you have without clinging to it."
    * "At the same time as the practice of negative visualization is helping us appreciate the world, it is
      preparing us for changes in that world. To practice negative visualization, after all, is to contemplate
      the impermanence of the world around us."
  * Periodically contemplating the impermanence of life, and recognizing that some things we do will be the
    last time we do them. E.g. walking the halls of our high school. Eating at a favorite restaurant before it
    closes down.
    * "Previously, when we thought we could repeat them at will, a meal at this restaurant or a kiss shared
      with our lover might have been unremarkable. But now that we know they cannot be repeated, they will
      likely become extraordinary events: the meal will be the best we ever had at the restaurant, and he
      parting kiss will be one of the most intensely bittersweet experiences life has to offer."
    * "By contemplating the impermanence of everything in this world, we are forced to recognize that every
      time we do something could be the last time we do it, and this recognition can invest the things we do
      with a significance and intensity that would otherwise be absent. We will no longer sleepwalk through
      our life.
* The dichotomy of control (chap 5)
  * Summary
    * Save a ton of mental bandwidth and anguish by identifying the things you worry about, over which you
      have no control, and stop worrying about them.
    * For the rest, set internal goals about your inputs, because you can control your inputs, your values,
      and character.
  * Set internal, not external goals.
    * One cannot fully control whether he wins the tennis match, but can control his internal goals, and
      inputs: play the best game possible given his current abilities.
    * "what better way is there to win a tennis match than by playing to the best of your ability? The Stoics
      realized that our internal goals will affect our external performance, but they also realized that the
      goals we consciously set for ourselves can have a dramatic impact on our subsequent emotional state."
      (So set your goal to play your best game, not to win, and let that goal naturally carry you to victory).
  * Rather than a goal of having my spouse love me, a related internal goal is to "behave in a lovable
    manner."
  * Reducing the sting of getting a manuscript rejected: "she should have as her goal not something external
    over which she has little control, such as getting her novel published, but something internal over which
    she has considerable control, such as how hard she works on the manuscript or how many times she submits
    it in a given period of time."
  * Internalizing one's goal to do one's best to change society is the only way to remain tranquil while
    participating in civil affairs and politics (because so little is under your control).
* Fatalism (chap 6)
  * "We must learn to welcome whatever falls to our lot and persuade ourselves that whatever happens to us is
    for the best. Indeed, according to Marcus, a good man will welcome 'every experience the looms of fate may
    weave for him.'"
    * "The fates" write the play, in which we are the actors.
  * "We can either spend this moment wishing it could be different, or we can embrace this moment. If we
    habitually do the former, we will spend much of our life in a state of dissatisfaction; if we habitually
    do the latter, we will enjoy our life. This, I think, is why the Stoics recommend that we be fatalistic
    with respect to the present."
  * (What's being described is like a form of negative visualization: rather than thinking about how our
    situation could be worse, so that we can enjoy it more, refuse to think about how it could be better, so
    we can remain present, and enjoy it.)
* Self-denial (chap 7)
  * "Voluntary discomfort"
    * Consider pretending that bad things have happened, and deprived you of your comforts, to appreciate more
      what you have. "Practicing poverty".
    * Like living in a cold climate for a season to appreciate your warm climate home.
  * Benefits
    * A form of training, to prepare the body and mind
      * "We harden ourselves against misfortunes that might befall us in the future.
    * Reduce anxiety about future calamities, after voluntarily experiencing minor ones
    * Appreciate what we already have
  * In addition to voluntary discomfort, Stoics advised periodically foregoing pleasure. Develop the muscle of
    self-control. Allows us to be able to focus and not be distracted by temptations.
  * "This self-control make sit far more likely that they will attain the goals of their philosophy of life,
    and this in turn dramatically increases their chances of living a good life."
  * Abstaining from pleasure can itself be a pleasure
    * "If you refrain from eating the ice cream, you will forgo this gastronomic pleasure but will experience
      pleasure of a different kind: As Epictetus observes, you will 'be pleased and will praise yourself' for
      not eating it."
    * "If we weighed the costs and benefits of eating it against the costs of not eating it -- we might find
      that the sensible thing for us to do, if we wish to maximize our pleasure, is not eat it."
