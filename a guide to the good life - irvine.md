* Intro
  * "A grand goal in living is the first component of a philosophy of life. This means that if you lack a
    grand goal in living, you lack a coherent philosophy of life."
    * The most important thing you want "out" of life.
* The first stoics (chap 2)
  * "The Stoics enjoyed whatever "good things" happened to be available, but even as they did so, they
    prepared themselves to give up the things in question."
    * In contrast to the asceticism of the Cynics.
  * Stoic virtue, which leads to a well-lived life.
    * "In the same way that a 'virtuous' (or excellent) hammer is one that performs well the function for
      which it was designed -- namely, to drive nails -- a virtuous individual is one who performs well the
      function for which humans were designed. To be virtuous, then, is to live as we were designed to live;
      it is to live, as Zeno put it, in accordance with nature. The stoics would add that if we do this, we
      will have a good life."
      * Cultivate the Earth, honor and take care of others, be rational.
  * Later the Roman stoics emphasized tranquility as the desirable by-product of pursuing virtue, and made
    tranquility the ultimate goal.
  * "By pointing to the tranquility people would gain by pursuing virtue -- they would make Stoic doctrines
    more attractive to ordinary Romans."
* Roman Stoicism (chap 3)
  * Compared to the deep joy of living virtuously, with content, and self-reliance, "pleasures of the flesh
    are 'paltry and trivial and fleeting.'"
  * Pairing life-philosophy with religion
    * "Epictetus would then tell the prospective student that if he wishes to have a good life, he must
      consider his nature and the purpose for which God created him and live accordingly."
  * "According to Marcus, it was Apollonius who impressed on him the need to be decisive and reasonable,
    taught him how to combine days full of intense activity with periods of relaxation, and taught him how,
    'with the same unaltered composure,' to withstand sickness and pain."
* Negative visualization (chap 4)
  * "Misfortune weighs most heavily on those who 'expect nothing but good fortune.'"
  * Hedonic adaptation
    * "We humans are unhappy in large part because we are insatiable; after working hard to get what we want
      we routinely lose interest in the object of our desire. Rather than feeling satisfied, we feel a bit
      bored, and in response to this boredom, we go on to form new, even grander desires."
    * This adaptation happens as our wealth increases, we accumulate nicer belongings, and as we marry. We
      take it for granted. The antidote is negative visualization.
    * This adaptation has the power to extinguish our enjoyment of the world.
    * "Satisfaction treadmill"
      * "There are doubtless many thing sin our life to which we have adapted, things that we once dreamed of
        having but that we now take for granted, including, perhaps, our spouse, our children, our house, our
        car, and our job."
    * "The easiest way for us to gain happiness is to learn how to want the things we already have."
    * "One reason children are capable of joy is because they take almost nothing for granted. To them, the
      world is wonderfully new and surprising."
  * Negative visualization
    * Seneca says "she should remember that all we have is 'on loan' from Fortune, which can reclaim it
      without our permission -- indeed, without even advanced notice." (including our dear ones).
    * Vividly picture yourself without all the things, your kids, etc. This elevates your appreciation and
      will make us more attentive.
    * It's a technique for promoting optimism. Appreciate the marvels that we have and the age that we live
      in.
  * "Epictetus counsels that when we say good-bye to a friend, we should silently remind ourselves that this
    might be our final parting. If we do this, we will be less likely to take our friends for granted, and as
    a result, we will probably derive far more pleasure from friendships than we otherwise would."
  * Most of us spend time thinking about the things we don't yet have. "We would be much better off, Marcus
    says, to spend this time thinking of all the things we have and reflecting on how much we would miss them
    if they were not ours." Or how we would feel if we lost our freedom.
  * "Contemplating our own death can dramatically enhance our enjoyment of life."
  * Catastrophes
    * A catastrophe has great value in that it can blast people out of their jadedness. Ironically, those who
      have experienced hardship are more joyful than those who haven't.
    * Negative visualization, in contrast to catastrophes:
      * We don't have to wait to engage in negative visualization the way we have to wait to be struck by a
        catastrophe.
      * Being struck by a catastrophe can easily kill us; engaging in negative visualization can't.
      * Because negative visualization can be done repeatedly, its beneficial effects, unlike those of a
        catastrophe, can last indefinitely.
  * Saying grace before a meal can be a form of negative visualization. Transform an ordinary meal into a
    cause for celebration.
  * Proud adults who look down on people who are satisfied. Argues that drive is not worth having if it comes
    at the expense of satisfaction.
    * "They have somehow gotten the idea that by refusing to take delight in the world, they are demonstrating
      their emotional maturity: to take delight in things, they think, is childish."
  * "Enjoy and appreciate what you have without clinging to it."
    * "At the same time as the practice of negative visualization is helping us appreciate the world, it is
      preparing us for changes in that world. To practice negative visualization, after all, is to contemplate
      the impermanence of the world around us."
  * Periodically contemplating the impermanence of life, and recognizing that some things we do will be the
    last time we do them. E.g. walking the halls of our high school. Eating at a favorite restaurant before it
    closes down.
    * "Previously, when we thought we could repeat them at will, a meal at this restaurant or a kiss shared
      with our lover might have been unremarkable. But now that we know they cannot be repeated, they will
      likely become extraordinary events: the meal will be the best we ever had at the restaurant, and he
      parting kiss will be one of the most intensely bittersweet experiences life has to offer."
    * "By contemplating the impermanence of everything in this world, we are forced to recognize that every
      time we do something could be the last time we do it, and this recognition can invest the things we do
      with a significance and intensity that would otherwise be absent. We will no longer sleepwalk through
      our life.
