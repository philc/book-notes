* Prelude
  * The efficiency-flexibility quandary: the more efficient you get, the harder it is to change."
  * Resources availability implies some inefficiency.
  * You increase efficiency by eliminating slack in the system. But slack is required for change.
* Madmen in the halls (chap 1)
  * The social convention for the effectiveness of someone is busyness -- "utilization". Think of Hollywood's
    standard depiction of a successful company: every employee is running around and "on it".
  * Flattening the hierarchy and removing middle management for efficiency wins are rewarded in the short-term
    by the stock market.
  * In cutting middle management, we cut the capacity to change.
    * "The main activity of those managers is reinvention. It is the middle of the organization where
      reinvention takes place. This is where the dynamic of today's organizational functioning is examined,
      taken apart, analyzed, resynthesized."
* Busyness (chap 2)
  * "Very successful companies have never struck me as particularly busy; in fact, they are, as a group,
    rather laid-back. Energy is evident in the workplace, but it's not the energy tinged with fear that comes
    from being slightly behind on everything."
  * The value of a secretary that's not entirely utilized
    * "She's available to do stuff that you or your people find you need to have done. That's part of what's
      so great about Sylvia: when something comes up, she can usually get cracking on it right away."
  * You can keep a whole work force busy (fully utilized) if you allow work to buffer at each point in the
    network (on each person's desk, or on each team's backlog). This has the effect of reducing the velocity
    of tasks through the system.
* The myth of fungible resources (chap 3)
  * A common strategy in restructuring is to allocate people into a pool so their partial time can be finely
    allocated to stakeholders.
  * "A highly partitioned worker can't be obsessively involved in any of his/her many fragmented tasks, and so
    tends not to bind into the team. Whatever the productivity boost due to team action may be, the
    partitioned worker does not benefit from it."
  * Task switching penalty = mechanics of moving to a new task + rework due to inopportune abort of previous
    task + immersion time for think-intensive tasks + frustration (emotional immersion in previous task) +
    loss of team binding effect.
    * From a live study of software developers in 1984, "we modeled performance against task-switching
      frequency and came to the conclusion that the best way to understand task switching was to assume that
      each switch imposes a direct penalty of 20m of concentration."
    * So, restructuring which increases fragmentation of work for each worker carries a large productivity
      penalty.
  * Author estimates ("in his experience") that no less than 15% loss in productivity (6hrs/week) having a
    person do two jobs versus one (i.e. cover two bases, or work with two teams). The penalty increases with
    many jobs.
* Managing Eve (chap 5)
  * For curious, hungry employees, work must be structured to provide growth. It's as essential as the
    paycheck.
  * Trying to control the work of volunteers in a non-profit, and robbing them of their motivation:
    * "If you looked over their shoulders enough or imposed standards that were different from their own, they
      would shrug and walk away from the work, leaving you to do it yourself. Control, as they see it, is
      their payment for working.
  * Most equate control as their main opportunity for growth
    * "You have to give her some leeway, some opportunity to choose her own directions and make her own
      mistakes. Mistakes are important here. If she has control over her choices only to the extend that she
      makes the same ones that you would have made for her, she has no control at all."
    * This can be called "control slack" -- enough slack in the system to absorb suboptimal choices, which
      provides the benefit of employee control.
  * "You have to create a real sense that control is not completely centralized in your hands, but spread
    generously over the whole of your organization. Like a gifted helmsman, who knows that all use of the
    rudder increases drag and thus holds the vessel back, you have to steer with the lightest possible touch."
  * It is not healthy for the management hierarchy lines to be the only communication conduit between partner
    orgs. These hierarchies are far too narrowband.
* Business instead of busyness (chap 6)
  * The benefits of having slack designed into the organization:
    * Responsiveness
    * Flexibility
    * Better people retention
    * A capacity to invest
  * Ability to change is valuable, but it costs money. How much should you invest in having an ability to
    change?
  * Ability to change cannot be siloed to dedicated "change specialists." It should be implemented in a
    diffuse way, as some portion of everyone's mindshare.
    * "Everybody needs to have some capacity to devote to change. This is time that people dedicate to
      rethinking how their piece of the whole works, and how it ought to work. Once the change is under way,
      more time is required to practice new ways and master new skills. That's the cost. The benefit is
      vitality and a firm grip on the future."
  * "Slack is the way you invest in change. Slack represents operational capacity sacrificed in the interests
    of long-term health."
  * "The right way to think about domain knowledge is as a corporate capital asset, as dollars of investment
    in the head of each knowledge worker, put there by organizational investment in that employee. When that
    person leaves, the asset is gone. If you did a rigorous accounting of this human capital, you would be
    obliged to declare an extraordinary loss each time one of your people quit."
  * The cost of a departing employee is: their salary * (rampup time / 2) + opportunity cost + training cost.
  * Multiply this by churn per month, and this is the cost the company is paying for human capital drain.
  * High utilization of a worker makes them feel "used", and leads to churn.
  * "I am much more concerned when smaller companies invest outside of their own product areas. I see this as
    bankruptcy of inventiveness. It is particularly evident when companies find themselves with extra leverage
    due to run-up of their stock price. Their willingness to spend this found capital outside their own
    backyard is a signal that they have no real vision, no idea of how to grow in the arena that they know
    best."
    * This bankruptcy can happen if there's not enough slack for resources to be set aside for invention.
    * "Companies keep their people too damn busy to invent."
