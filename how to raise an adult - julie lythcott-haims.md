  * "As I looked ahead to the college years and imagined the degree of self-reliance I would hope they'd have
    by then, I began focusing on how to provide more opportunities for independence during childhood."
  * "Research shows that family dinners help kids feel they matter to the parent, and as a result they have a
    positive impact on kids' mental health and lead to greater self-esteem and greater academic achievement.
    In addition to talking to our kids about their day or their lives, talking to them about current events
    scales the level of critical thinking up a level -- to a level of theoretical challenge, to a degree of
    interest in the world around them, and to a degree of humility about what they don't yet know. It makes
    them hungry to know more."
  * "College is a match to be made, not a prize to be won."
  * "Your kid is not your passion. If you treat them as if they are, you're placing them in the very untenable
    and unhealthy role of trying to bring fulfillment to *your* life."
* Intro
  * "When a parent (usually a mom" would throw the door open on weekday afternoons and tell us, 'Go out and
    play and be home for dinner.' Our parents had no idea where we were or exactly what we were doing. There
    were no cell phones for keeping in touch or GPS devices for tracking. Off we went into the wilderness of
    our block our neighborhood, our town, our vacant lots, our parks, our woods, our malls. Or sometimes, we
    just snuck a book and sat on the back steps. Childhood doesn't look that way today and many young parents
    don't relate to childhood ever having been that way."
    * Yes, so true -- this is what my childhood felt like.
  * Why did we stop letting our kids free play in the neighborhood? Argues it was outsized fear in the 1980s
    over child abductions (milk carton missing kids, America's most Wanted) and fear that American students
    are falling behind China and Japan ("no child left behind" policy).
    * Also, scheduled "play dates" became required as mothers increased their participation in the workforce.
  * Parents of millennials: "Each subsequent year would bring an increase in the number of parents who did
    things like seek opportunities, make decisions, and problem solve for their sons and daughters -- things
    that college-aged students used to be able to do for themselves."
  * Boomer parents: the problem is the supplanting. They "wanted to 'be there' for their kids, whatever it
    took, still challenging the system, but now on behalf of their kids, often supplanting themselves as a
    buffer between their kids and the system and its authority figures."
  * We over-protect our kids and over-direct their time, shielding them from experiences that may toughen and
    weather them.
    * "Our neighborhoods are photo-worthy, our food and wine are carefully paired, but with childhood feeling
      more and more like an achievement arms race, can we call what twe and our children are living a 'good
      life'?"
* Keeping them safe and sound (chap 1)
  * Argues that fears have escalated with global media coverage of abductions, but the stats don't
    substantiate these fears. Most missing children (by far) end up being runaways, not abductees.
  * ANd the fear of stranger danger causes parents to escort their kids everywhere, and shortchange their
    chance to develop independence.
  * "Basically, the 24/7/365 worldwide news cycle is a recent development in human existence and we haven't
    evolved to cope with it yet. There *is* such a thing as too much information."
  * "The *unexamined* harm these days is that our kids grow up *believing* that an evil stranger, a fellow
    shopper in the grocery store, or worse, a neighbor offering candy at Halloween wants to do them harm or
    that their own parent is putting them in harm's way."
  * "As I looked ahead to the college years and imagined the degree of self-reliance I would hope they'd have
    by then, I began focusing on how to provide more opportunities for independence during childhood."
  * "Porter encourages parents and educators to avoid the bully label and instead help children develop the
    resilience needed to handle the harsh social challenges of life."
  * In response to aggression from their peer, "'When you intervene on behalf of your child, your child
    becomes the victim. You're expressing the message 'You're incapable, you're not sturdy enough to resolve
    this yourself, you need me to come in and take care of this for you.' You are, in essence, disempowering
    your child."
  * "In France, autonomous and independent play is highly valued, so the adults are much more likely to sit
    passively or chat among themselves on the sidelines. In the United States the constant stimulation of our
    narration and praise can be exhausting for both parents and kids, and can make play less fun."
  * "American parents seem to have equated 'good' or 'successful' parenting with ensuring our kids never
    experience even minor, short-term pain." (like skinned knees on playgrounds).
  * "If you think about it, we worry when we don't hear from our kids only because it is now possible to be in
    constant touch. Merely ten to fifteen years ago it was impossible to check up on kids like this."
  * "We should open our eyes to the many ways in which hyper-vigilance keeps them penned in from the more
    liberated life they deserve to live and that in turn would prepare them for adulthood."
    * E.g. we "tag along" on a road trip via constant cell phone contact, rather than letting them disappear
      for a weekend.
* Providing opportunity (chap 2)
  * Parents have come "on top of it all," managing a full schedule of enrichment activities for their kids.
  * Parents encourage kids to specialize in a sport early.
  * Parents used to attend only the big games; now they attend everything.
  * We're manufacturing kids so they have all the properties to make it through college admissions.
    Ironically, admissions people are looking for insight into your kid's authentic character, and we deprive
    them of those experiences.
  * (Stanford Students, describing their parents) "Each of us described in our own way how our parents were
    supportive but relatively hands off throughout high school, and that they told us to calm down and to
    relax in high school much more often than they applied pressure."
  * "If we've taught our kids that there is one predetermined checklist for their lives, we may be
    constructing a path that is more about us than them. And a path that isn't about them may be a path to
    nowhere."
* Being there for them (chap 3)
  * (Anecdotes about parents over-managing their kids, not letting them become independent and self-reliant,
    even as young adults).
* Succumbing to the college admissions arms race (chap 4)
  * Increasing numbers of parents want their kids to fill slots at a limited number of schools. It's an arms
    race to push kids through a checklisted childhood.
  * (Fun anecdote) "The professor learned over to me and told me that one night it was well past bedtime and
    each of his three kids -- all Palo Alto public schoolers -- had a mountain of homework still to be done.
    His solution? He told his elementary schooler to go to bed, told his middle schooler to do the elementary
    kid's homework, told his high schooler to do the homework for his middle schooler, and he himself, the
    professor, did the homework for the high schooler. Sure, it's problematic. But why criticize this
    short-term repair when the system itself is so broken?"
  * "If parents aren't doing the homework but they're running out and hiring tutors to help kids with their
    homework, it's the same thing. It fosters a sense of dependence and helplessness in kids; they come to
    feel they just can't do it on their own."
  * Parents do their kids' homework, monitor the scores daily, and even impersonate their kids over email. The
    parents are the ones going to school In comparison to the homework, the work produce in class by the
    student is vacuous.
* To what end? (chap 5)
  * "As I remember it, those warm summer nights of not being focused on were liberating, in the long sticky
    hours of boredom, in the lonely, unsupervised, unstructured time, something blooms; it was in those
    margins that we became ourselves." - Katie Roiphe, In Praise of Messy Lives
  * The author is wishing for the freedoms that kids had in the 80s and 90s -- producing more robust people.
    An environment that's like a free run, rather than a treadmill.
  * "There is a side of contemporary American culture -- fearful, litigious, controlling -- that we do not
    brag about but that we reveal in our child rearing."
  * "There are two things children should get from their parents: roots and wings" - Johann Wolfgang von
    Goethe.
  * "There's no freedom. No play. Hell-bent on removing all risks of life and on catapulting them into the
    college with the right brand nae, we've robbed our kids of the chance to construct and know their own
    *selves*."
* Our kids lack basic life skills (chap 6)
  * "An eighteen-year-old must be able to cope with ups and downs of courses and workloads, college-level
    work, competition, tough teachers, bosses, and others. The crutch: we stop in when things get hard, finish
    the task, extend the deadline, and talk to the adults; thus, kids don't know that in the normal course of
    life things won't always go their way, and that they'll be okay regardless."
  * "The orphan as role model" -- because of their self-reliance, even without parental support.
* They've been psychologically harmed (chap 7)
  * When consulted by their kids, it's more empowering if parents use the socratic method, rather than making
    the kid's decisions for them and telling them what to do.
  * "The research shows that figuring out for themselves is a critical element to a person's mental health.
    Your kids have to be there for *themselves*."
  * Let your kids build resilience. Let them do for themselves what they can already do, or can almost do.
  * (Amy Chun's tiger mom book sounds awful)
  * "If you become a neurosurgeon concert pianist, good for you. Your parent pushed you. You don't get that
    without someone *making* you do your homework and *making* you practice."
* We're hurting their job prospects (chap 9
  * Over-parented kids are not equipped for workforce scenarios. "Orchids" -- they perish outside the
    greenhouse.
  * Forest play-group for four-year-olds: "a weekly four-hour excursion into the forest, rain or shine, where
    the children saw and file wood, and roast hot dogs over an open fire for lunch." (sounds awesome!)
* Overparenting stresses us out, too (chap 10)
  * We "Do parenting" with a misplaced achievement mindset, making their life our accomplishment.
* The college admission process is broken (chap 11)
  * Colleges are like restaurants. There is no best one; they are each good in different ways.
  * Stanford's accept rate is 5-7% per year. "We're pushing our kids towards an artificially scarce
    education."
  * A 3.8 GPA vs 4.0 GPA: this is "'The narcissism of small differences' -- the meaningless distinctions
    people make to feel superior to those who are exactly like them." Bill Deresiewicz.
  * A high achieving high school student: "I hope that there will eventually be the restoration of childhood.
    Maybe one day we won't be stuck with paralyzing stress, just the stress that pushes us forward in positive
    ways."
  * SAT: "it measures not aptitude but one's ability to study for the test, which boils down to wealth. Here's
    how: SAT scores improve as a student studies for and retakes the tests. (The more test prep and testing a
    student can afford, the higher their scores. This means that SAT scores correlate highly with
    socioeconomic status rather than cognitive ability."
* The case for another way (chap 12)
  * Our job is to position our children to be independent from us, to be capable so that they can raise the
    next generation when we're gone.
  * "Self-efficacy means having the belief in your abilities to complete a task, reach goals, and manage a
    situation."
  * Self-efficacy is knowledge about one's realistic capability, whereas self-esteem is knowledge about one's
    worth.
  * The sweet spot is "authoritative": "demanding and responsive, these parents set high standards and limits,
    which they uphold with consequences. They are also emotionally warm, and responsive to their child's
    emotional needs. They give their child freedom to explore, to fail, and to make their own choices."
* Give them unstructured time (chap 13)
  * Children have a right to relax and free play.
  * "Embrace play as a developmental necessity for your child, and figure out how to fit free play into your
    family calendar."
    * Rather than letting it get encroached upon. Protect it, as we do sleep.
  * Lego blocks foster imaginative play. Lego sets with 100 steps do not.
  * "Resist the temptation to narrate everything they do as it's happening; let them come to you and tell you
    all about it. When they do, you can ask them good questions that demonstrate your interest as well as
    develop in them a deeper understanding about what they've experienced and learned."
  * "The real formative experiences of my childhood were about me and my friends in my neighborhood exploring,
    learning, playing, having a flow experience all day. Doing one thing, then another thing, having that
    total freedom." - Mike Lanza
    * (Yes, me too!)
  * "Montessori 'unfolds' students instead of 'molding' them."
  * "Good old-fashioned natural free play provides an environment in which kids can experience flow."
    * Conversely, highly structured schedules may afford them little flow.
  * "Noticing when we're in flow means noticing what we love doing. When we can look back on an experience and
    realize we were inf low, we've gotten a great clue from ourselves that we're doing something that matters
    to us, which can lead to meaningful work and hobbies."
  * "Having a TV in a kid's bedroom is one of the worst things because then they end up taking the easy way
    and when they're bored they turn on the TV."
* Teach life skills (chap 14)
  * "The mountain climber takes pride in planting his flag at the top because it took a lot to get there. If
    he took a helicopter it wouldn't feel the same. In facilitating success parents are paradoxically
    guaranteeing that a kid can't achieve it on his own." - David McCullough Jr
  * "I see that my husband and I did way too much for our kids instead of welcoming them to the joy of dong
    more and more things on their own." (Nice framing)
* Teach them how to think (chap 15)
  * "If we want our kids to be able to think for themselves, we have to be willing to open up a dialogue with
    them and resist the natural temptation to give the answer, say what we know about a situation, solve the
    problem, and in other ways shut the dialogue -- and think thinking -- down."
    * Keep asking "why" -- go through the full dialog with them, as Socrates did with his students.
    * "The kid learned that the parent doesn't feel responsible for the problem and that he is going to have
      to figure it out for himself."
  * "Research shows that family dinners help kids feel they matter to the parent, and as a result they have a
    positive impact on kids' mental health and lead to greater self-esteem and greater academic achievement.
    In addition to talking to our kids about their day or their lives, talking to them about current events
    scales the level of critical thinking up a level -- to a level of theoretical challenge, to a degree of
    interest in the world around them, and to a degree of humility about what they don't yet know. It makes
    them hungry to know more."
  * Play devil's advocate to whatever your kid says, so they can't get by with just aligning with your view
    point.
* Prepare them for hard work (chap 16)
  * The role of chores: developing the willingness to pitch in.
  * "All a kid has to do is say 'I have a test' and we parents wait on them hand and foot as if they are
    'fascist dictators' or 'handicapped royalty.'"
  * "Chores build the kind of work ethic that is highly sought after in our communities and in the workplace."
    * Even if their "sweat equity" isn't needed, make children participate in chores.
  * "Don't expect perfection. It's no fun for them if you ask them to do something and then micromanage every
    step. They won't do it as well or as efficiently as you -- accept that."
  * Say "I need your help."
  * Teach them to appreciate the act of "doing what needs to be done."
  * Teach work ethic by example. Work alongside them.
  * Don't apologize or overexplain
    * "Overexplaining makes you look like you feel the need to justify your request. And if you apologize in
      the asking, along the way, or after the fact, you'll undercut your own authority as a parent who has the
      right and responsibility to ask your kid to help out."
* Let them chart their own path (chap 17)
  * 'I stopped focusing on what particular *thing* my kids would become."
  * "Study what you love, and the rest will follow" -- you will more easily obtain mastery because you're
    intrinsically motivated.
  * "Embrace the kid you've got": When plotting the arc of their profession, we tend to see who they aren't,
    and their gaps, rather than who they are.
  * Notice who your kid actually is: "which subjects do they pursue with vigor, discuss excitedly, and persist
    at when there's a challenge?"
    * And how they like to approach problems and situations -- their style.
  * "Fan the flames" -- at family dinners, dig into the most enjoyable part of your kid's day to identify the
    nugget that made it enjoyable for them.
  * Help your children find mentors outside the home
    * "Almost any adult is happy to respond to the simple, thoughtful question 'You seem to love what you do.
      When and how did you figure out that's what you wanted to do?' This question is an icebreaker any kid
      can ask any adult."
  * Have your own purpose
    * "Too often, our kids hear us complaining about things; let them hear what pulls you toward work instead
      of what pushes you away from it."(
* Normalize struggle (chap 18)
  * Argues that college students lack the ability to cope with adversity. They're "failure deprived." Kids
    need to learn that struggle and failure happens to everyone, and not to be ashamed.
  * Show your love. "When your kid gets home from school or activities, or you get home from work, set aside
    what you're doing, step away from your computer, put down your phone, and let them see the joy their
    presence brings you."
  * (I should implement more protected "reunion time" where we can show each other joy and appreciation when
    the kids arrive home from school.)
  * Notice them being good: "I saw you", not "you're amazing."
  * Setbacks are essential "growth producing events." They're being pruned out of childhoods by over-active
    parents.
  * An explanation for why affluent kids and children of immigrants have trouble finding their way is that
    they're deprived of opportunities for perseverance, grit, hardship, tough tradeoffs, and realistic
    feedback relative to poor kids.
* Have a wider mind-set about colleges (chap 19)
  * "Today we have a large number of students at great places who feel they really ought to be someplace else.
    If you walk around with that mind-set, it's going to wreck your college experience. Aall of these places
    are *gifts*, but they aren't treated as gifts, because students spend all their time thinking they should
    have gotten in to a different school."
  * (It's true: schools are ranked high mostly because of selectivity, not quality. Can we let go of the
    notion that we need to beat the punishing odds, and just enjoy the process and appreciate the school that
    we got into?)
  * "Many kids would choose a different kind of race, and perhaps a chance to enjoy the ride of childhood
    instead of racing right through it."
  * The 10 most selective schools have only an admissions rate of 5-10%. But the next 30 are 10-20%. The next
    60 are 20-33%. There's 2600 U.S. colleges.
  * Kids admitted to top colleges but who attend elsewhere end up with the same average income.
  * "Kids at less prestigious schools are apt to be more interesting, more curious, more open, more
    appreciative of what they're getting, and far less entitled and competitive. They tend to act like peers
    instead of rivals."
  * "The world only cares about -- and pays off on -- what you can do with what you know (and it doesn't care
    how you learned it.)" (Laszlo's Bock's book)
  * LinkedIn's school data shows which schools high-ranking jobs originate from.
  * E.g. Tufts university: elite, but uses a holistic view fro admissions, and stresses kindness.
    * Tufts' dean: "I don't want an undergraduate community of cutthroat robots."
  * When considering a school, ask alums, current students, and parents what they would change about their
    university experience, rather than "would you recommend it?"
  * "That they're engaged in learning is what counts. That they're curious. That they want to grow, and serve,
    and one day do something of purpose and meaning in the world. That they're en route to figuring out what
    that is."
  * "College is a match to be made, not a prize to be won."
* Listen to them (chap 20)
  * Home should feel like an oasis. (Interesting vision)
  * (Includes an essay by a well-adjusted, self-motivated, independent-minded kid about his experience of
    college admissions. Awesome to read)
* Reclaim your self (chap 21)
  * "They're going to get to be twenty-five and think, 'I never saw grown-ups living a life. I only saw them
    doing stuff for me, driving around, standing somewhere on a Saturday morning.'"
  * "Do we show up in their lives as a person who walks through the world feeling good about ourselves, doing
    work that plays to our strengths and resonates with our values, and who makes time for meaningful human
    connection with them and with others."
    * Serving as their most important role models... or are we hurried, demotivated by our job, and chasing
      them for homework?
  * "Your kid is not your passion. If you treat them as if they are, you're placing them in the very untenable
    and unhealthy role of trying to bring fulfillment to *your* life."
  * How to be who you want to be? Seek to do what you're proud to be doing; where you can find flow, pursue
    curiosity, and have purpose.
  * For obligations handed out by the parenting herd, consider saying "no" to the petty ones, and for the
    rest, aim only to do a "good enough" job.
  * Let your happiness be independent of theirs.
    * Perhaps a better parental desire is for our children to be in control of their destiny, making their
      choices how they want to, and demonstrating good values along the way.
* Be the parent you want to be (chap 22)
  * "If your kid wants you to be overly involved in homework by solving it, figuring it out, or writing it for
    them, try saying, 'I've been a fourth/sixth/eighth grader before. Now it's your turn.'"
    * (I want them to learn how to do high quality work without me.)
  * When you hear a parent say that a kid "has to" do a certain activity to get into school X, consider
    replying with a smile "we've stopped trying to predict what some small set of colleges may want, and we've
    started just living our life, which turns out to feel much better."
    * And "A great college education is to be had at many, many places. We're not going to stress about it."
      * "Your kid really needs to hear this come out of your mouth, so say this in front of them as often as
        you can."
  * Recommends going and finding a handful of lesser-known schools that are high quality, and get excited
    about them and name-drop them periodically, so that our kids, and our peer parents, don't get anchored to
    the short list of most-selective schools.
  * Find like-minded parents.
  * Soccer is an enriching activity for your kid, but not for you on the sideline.
    * "Ask them to pick a few games to which they'd really like you to show up and commit to being there."
  * Diffusing your own jealousy or FOMO when your neighbor's kids are attending an exclusive college: "What
    matters is not where kids are but that they are blossoming where they are."
  * Competitive travel sports leagues take a huge toll on the family's rhythm.
    * "She wants a lot of downtime at home. She wants to do art, and play, and it doesn't work with this kid
      when she's pushed to do too many activities." (Carmen, a mother)
  * "Those of us who are unable to consider anything other than the currently popular overparenting model of
    child rearing may not be living lives of choice; we may have let the herd choose for us -- and for our
    children."
