* Gems
  * Find a place "... with the power to help us develop into the sort of people we need to
    become."
  * "We need to lie on the beach not because we are light-minded or indolent, but because we can be
    so dangerously dutiful, serious, hard-working, disconnected from our body, over-cerebral and
    cautious."
  * "The view [from the plane] helps us to have more kindly thoughts about those left back at home. Their faults drop
    away against the backdrop of the Southern Alps or the Singapore Strait. We want to be patient
    and warm around them. We see the broader outlines of their lives. We'd like to tell them in
    franker, more direct terms how fond we are of them."
* How to choose a destination (chap 1)
  * "Every destination has a character: that is, it emphasizes and promotes a particular aspect of
    human nature."
    * Scenes of serenity, ambition, suffering, elegance.
  * "The destination we find ourselves drawn to reflects an underlying sense of what is currently
    missing or under-supported in our lives. We are seeking, through our travels, not just to see
    new places, but also to become fuller, more complete beings."
    * Similar to what art we find beautiful.
    * Find a place "... with the power to help us develop into the sort of people we need to
      become."
* What is "exotic"? (chap 2)
  * "It merely means anywhere we yearn to go which we suspect has something important to teach
    us."
  * "Sadly, too often, we're shy about investigating what might really be exotic to us. We may end
    up in more cliched 'exotic' places from a shyness about locating and declaring our true
    interests. We're often still at the dawn of properly knowing ourselves."
* The suspicion of happiness (chap 3)
  * A common fear which prevents us from enjoying travel: "If I settle back, throw away my cares for
    a time and enjoy what I have, I will lose the will to strive -- which has been responsible for
    everything I have achieved to date."
    * (In my experience, I get an itch to return to "being productive" 5-7 days into any trip.)
    * "Unless we learn how to appreciate what we have, there is no point striving for more."
    * "Appreciation does not rule out compassion. Indeed, the more satisfied and rested we are, the
      more strength we have to bring to bear on the trouble of others."
* Anxiety (chap 4)
  * "We should be more careful when heading for destinations that we imagine will spare us every
    anxiety. We can go, but with a little more skepticism about our likely mood. It is rare to be
    uncomplicatedly happy for longer than fifteen minutes."
    * We're anxious creatures by nature. Travel doesn't help with that.
* The importance of the sun (chap 7)
  * We can "Feel our character changing in the sun: becoming something we like a lot more. When the
    world seems bountiful and easy (as it does in the heat), material accumulation looks less
    impressive or necessary. When we can have so much pleasure from sitting in a T-shirt and shorts
    and feasting on a feta and tomato salad, competing wildly for promotion loses its point. When it
    is so hot, there is no point even trying to read -- or think too much."
  * "We need to lie on the beach not because we are light-minded or indolent, but because we can be
    so dangerously dutiful, serious, hard-working, disconnected from our body, over-cerebral and
    cautious."
  * Seeking the sun is part of the "deeply noble search for wisdom and balance."
* Travel as a cure for shyness (chap 8)
  * Through travel, you're freeing yourself from your inhibitions. You're growing up -- and into
    yourself. Our journeys can teach us a vital skill: that of not minding so much if we
    occasionally look a fool. They may be the best conduits for developing into the more confident,
    less self-conscious people we crave to be."
* The pleasure of the airport (chap 9)
  * "The problem with the airport is that we tend to go there when we have a plane to catch. As a
    result, we are panicked, argumentative, stressed."
  * The airport is where many amazing journeys are about to begin among the people there. Do some
    people watching and speculate about what will happen tot hem.
* The pleasures of the flight (chap 10)
  * "The world feels large and we very small -- and the contrast is delightful. On this scale, the
    actions and concerns of our own lives don't really count for much. We're beautifully reminded of
    our own thorough unimportance."
  * "Across history, people have imagined their gods living on lofty mountaintops or in the sky,
    looking down beningly on human life. It's not a random association: from this height we can
    smile gently at humanity and perhaps love it a little, too."
  * "The view helps us to have more kindly thoughts about those left back at home. Their faults drop
    away against the backdrop of the Southern Alps or the Singapore Strait. We want to be patient
    and warm around them. We see the broader outlines of their lives. We'd like to tell them in
    franker, more direct terms how fond we are of them."
  * "As we start the descent, helped by the complex maneuvers of the plane through the lower
    atmosphere, we dream of becoming the people we long to be."
