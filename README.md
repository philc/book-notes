# Book notes

These are notes about impactful books that I've read. The notes are not meant to be comprehensive;
I've recorded the parts which were most impactful to me at the time of reading, so that I can better
retain the material.

I hope these notes give a sense of what a given book is about, and encourage people to purchase the
book if it looks relevant to them. All content in this repository is copyright the book's author(s).

You can view the notes here on GitHub, or as more nicely-formatted HTML
[here](https://notes.philcrosby.com).

## Conventions

* Sentences in quotes are quotes from the book.
* Sentences in parentheses are my personal comments.
* Some books have a "gems" section at the top which contains the parts that I most want to remember.
