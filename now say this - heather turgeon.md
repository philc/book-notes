  * "The premise that your child is good will inform how you interpret tough behaviors and stuck
    moments. Rather than responding with threats or punishments, you can see your child as a small
    person with good intentions, figuring out a big world. You have an opportunity to understand,
    set limits, and guide."
  * "If kids are controlled by fear and judgement, they aren't challenged to develop their own moral
    compass. They don't build an internal sense of good that carries them through the moments when
    no one is watching."
* Intro
  * "[Parents] often feel like drill sergeants, issuing no's, yelling, and time-outing."
  * "Your child is capable and built for good"
    * On raising unruly, entitled kids: "Whichever camp they're in, though, most parents tell ust hat
      something is missing. When they're very strict, they end up feeling guilty and worry they're
      missing a deeper connection to their kids. When they try to empathize and be flexible, they
      often feel ineffective and resentful."
* Three steps for communicating in difficult moments (chap 1)
  * "win-win": being able to parent with these qualities which are at odds with each other
    * Warmth vs. high-expectations
    * Empathy vs. clear limits
    * Kind vs. consistent
  * Parental breakdown: "A mom with endless warmth who cannot hold limits and feels walked all over
    by her kids."
  * ALP method: Attune -> limit set -> problem solve
  * Your child is "built for good" -- naturally wired to be empathetic and learn from experience.
  * "The premise that your child is good will inform how you interpret tough behaviors and stuck
    moments. Rather than responding with threats or punishments, you can see your child as a small
    person with good intentions, figuring out a big world. You have an opportunity to understand,
    set limits, and guide."
  * Unhelpful view: "kids need tough love. That's what makes a good parent." More helpful and
    accurate: "how we treat our children affects how they treat everyone else."
  * Kids might be disobeying at bedtime, but because they've missed mom and want to connect with
    her, and don't know how to show it. This response meets their needs better than a threat of "no
    story time!"
    * "I see silly people running all over the place here. Hey, everyone, urgent cuddle 911! I've
      missed you guys so much today. I'm excited to see what happens in the next chapter of that
      book we started last night. So teeth and then meet me on the couch!"
  * The author uses the analogy "tip of the iceberg"
    * If they're not listening, that's the final output of what is probably a set of underlying
      causes, which might include: needs contact; tired/hungry; overscheduled; in a new environment;
      overstimulated; feeling inferior; sad/angry.
    * "Instead of butting heads over the behaviors at the tip of the iceberg, you address them from
      the bottom up. Now you're connected, and your words are more effective."
  * The adult's responsibility is to ask "what is underneath this annoying behavior?" Difficult
    behavior is an opportunity to attune.
  * Emotions sometimes come in intense spells -- storms -- this is to be expected, and they always pass.
  * Let it be OK when your kid has emotions, rather than feeling as if you have to fix difficult
    emotions. Be a safe bedrock.
    * "Emotions are okay. They come and go, they aren't forever or scary. I'm here with you no
      matter what and I'm okay with all your feelings."
  * "If kids are controlled by fear and judgement, they aren't challenged to develop their own moral
    compass. They don't build an internal sense of good that carries them through the moments when
    no one is watching."
  * Rewards lower intrinsic motivation and teach that the behavior being rewarded is distasteful, so
    the behavior will not persist in the long run when the reward is absent.
  * Shaming, bribing, threats: "If children are capable and built for good, none of these tactics
    are necessary. They all imply that a child needs to be tricked or forced to do the right thing."
  * "At the end of the day, we all yearn for connection. We want our trusted people to see and
    understand us, especially in vulnerable moments."
  * If a parent can develop the skill of attunement, their kids will keep coming to confide in them
    even as they get older.
  * Attuning is:
    * Pausing rather than reacting with your own feelings first
    * Listening and watching with genuine curiosity
    * Communicating that you understand or you're trying to understand
    * Creating the experience of feeling seen and heard
  * "Leading with understanding side steps power struggles."
    * "I'm with you. I'm here to guide and help you. We're in this together."
  * How to attune
    * Pause: attune by pausing before you react. "Harder than it sounds."
      * Respond with "Hmm, let's think about this."
    * Use your body language
      * Make them feel safe and open. Standing over your child is an offensive move. At eye level is
        a collaborative move.
    * Say what you see: the sportscaster
      * Use an observant, and curious tone, not blaming. Helps them remain open while seeing cause
        and effect.
    * Paraphrase what you're hearing; be a "good waiter"
  * "Try not to insert or project your own feelings, but see his behavior as understandable, given
    his development level."
    * They don't yet know what's trivial vs. important.
  * When placing limits, they should be paired with explanation. This helps the child extrapolate to
    future scenarios.
    * Attune: "You want those cookies from this grocery store huh? I know they look good."
    * Limit set: "we're not buying that today because w're just getting what we need for our meals."
  * "As kids get older, if you have consistently held reasonable limits without caving or
    flip-flopping, they will internalize these lessons and their testing of them will naturally
    decrease."
  * Problem solving
    * "The gist of the problem-solving step is 'here's what you *can* do!'"
    * "When things don't go their way, optimists feel a sense of agency to overcome, rather than the
      pessimist's tendency to blame outside forces for their problems."
    * The "head-scratching, bumbling parent": create space for them to come alongside and propose the
      obvious solution.
    * The "follow-through" choice: an escape hatch where the parent can take control of the situation
      * "Can you lead us out of the store? (Pause) It seems like it's hard to leave. You can walk
        yourself or I will carry you."
    * Calm down instead of time-out
      * Time out implements isolation and shaming. The kid ends up resenting the parent and the
        sibling they were hurting.
      * "Calm down": separation, but with you present as a team. After it's done, "please check in
        with your sister."
      * "Mom: whoa, okay I saw that. That was too rough. Come and sit with me for a few minutes to
        calm down. You're showing me you need a break to regroup. I'm going to help you take a
        breather."
  * Repair and circle back
    * Some ruptures are routine, like getting mildly frustrated. Some are toxic, like screaming or
      insulting.
    * "Repair is when we help our kids make sense of what happened. It brings us back together and
      kids get the sense that we're still 'with' them, even if something difficult happened. Repair
      is part of how babies and children build trust -- they see that even when people disagree and
      become disconnected, they come back together again."
      * This also applies to parental fights in front of kids.
    * "kids notice and register our words and reactions all the time. If they feel a rupture, they
      log it and it stays with them. If they can't make sense out of why ti happened, the memory can
      be stored in a way that compromises their future relationships. It's like a piece of the
      puzzle is missing."
    * Model humility by repairing. Messing up is an opportunity for good.
  * "Parenting is made up of thousands of small moments that together tell a story that can be
    beautiful and meaningful."
