<h2>Gems</h2>
<ul>
<li>When completing a programming project: there's &quot;quadratic rather than linear convergence to the
end.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Men and months are interchangeable commodities only when a task can be partitioned among many
workers <em>with no communication among them</em>. This is true of reaping wheat or picking cotton; it is
not even approximately true of systems programming.&quot;</li>
<li>Brook's Law: Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</li>
<li>The number of minds coordinating to build a system determines the system debugging cost, because
that phase is largely determined by miscommunication between many minds. So you want a system
built by as few minds as possible.</li>
<li>Surgical team
<ul>
<li>Colorful analogy: &quot;Each segment of a large job be tackled by a team, but that the team be
organized like a surgical team rather than a hog-butchering team. That is, instead of each
member cutting away on the problem, one does the cutting and the others give him every support
that will enhance his effectiveness and productivity.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Differences in judgement among a team of equals takes time to talk through. There are far fewer
such differences on the surgical team.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The tar pit (chap 1)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most teams building large systems become ensnared in a prehistoric tar pit — getting more stuck
and going slower as the project progresses.</li>
<li>Growing cost when producing the final product:
<ul>
<li>Going from a program -&gt; a programming product incurs a 3x growth in complexity.
<ul>
<li>A programming product requires generalization of the feature set, testing, documentation, and
ongoing maintenance.</li>
<li>This is the transition that a program that was written for personal use undergoes before it's
usable by the public, or open-sourced.
<ul>
<li>(Yes — it's always requires a surprising amount of extra work to make my personal software
usable by other people.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Going from a program -&gt; a programming system incurs a 3x growth in complexity.
<ul>
<li>A programming system is a collection of interfacing programs for large tasks. E.g. a
distributed system, or a programming language toolchain.</li>
<li>The interfaces between each program must be rigorously defined.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So when going from a single program -&gt; released programming system, it's about 9x as expensive
as the first cut at the problem (the simple program).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The joys of the craft
<ul>
<li>(Nice mini-essay on the joys of programming)</li>
<li>The sheer joy of making things</li>
<li>The pleasure of making things that are useful to other people</li>
<li>A fascination of fashioning a complex machine</li>
<li>Joy from learning</li>
<li>Delight of working in such a tractable (malleable) medium</li>
<li>&quot;Programming is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights
sensibilities we have in common with all men.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Woes of the craft
<ul>
<li>&quot;Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it.&quot;</li>
<li>When completing a programming project: there's &quot;quadratic rather than linear convergence to the
end.&quot;</li>
<li>With software, there's a short time to obsolescence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The mythical man-month (chap 2)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Estimates embed the unvoiced assumption that &quot;all will go well.&quot;</li>
<li>The gaps and inconsistencies of the idea only become visible in the implementation stage, rather
than in the design stage.</li>
<li>In other creative disciplines, difficulty expressing the idea — the implementation phase — is
blamed on the medium, because it's intractable. Wood splits, paints smear. In programming, one
cannot make this excuse.</li>
<li>&quot;Men and months are interchangeable commodities only when a task can be partitioned among many
workers <em>with no communication among them</em>. This is true of reaping wheat or picking cotton; it is
not even approximately true of systems programming.&quot;</li>
<li>Sequential constraints in the project prevent parallelism.</li>
<li>Time required is sub-linear with men because the cost of communication and training (for each
person) must be added to the cost of the project.</li>
<li>If each person in each partition needs to join shared group meetings, the communication cost can
explode.</li>
<li>&quot;Failure to allow enough time for a system test, in particular, is peculiarly disastrous. Since
the delay comes at the end of the schedule, no one is aware of schedule trouble until almost the
delivery date.&quot;</li>
<li>Brook's Law: Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</li>
<li>The number of months a project will take depends on the number of sequential constraints.</li>
<li>The number of men a project can use depends on the number of independent subtasks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The surgical team (chap 3)</h2>
<ul>
<li>The phenomenon of 10x engineers has been &quot;widely observed.&quot;</li>
<li>The number of minds coordinating to build a system determines the system debugging cost, because
that phase is largely determined by miscommunication between many minds. So you want a system
built by as few minds as possible.</li>
<li>&quot;This then is the problem with the small, sharp team concept: it is too slow for really big
systems.&quot;</li>
<li>(It seems to me you can achieve &quot;conceptual integrity&quot; by creating a handful of small, sharp
10-person teams and aggressively controlling for and minimizing the coordination cost. E.g.
defining a rigid shared interface that allows for almost complete decoupling.)</li>
<li>Mill's proposal: organize each team within a group like a surgical team
<ul>
<li>A 10 person team where each role is highly specialized and the software is only really designed
and built by one mind.</li>
<li>Colorful analogy: &quot;Each segment of a large job be tackled by a team, but that the team be
organized like a surgical team rather than a hog-butchering team. That is, instead of each
member cutting away on the problem, one does the cutting and the others give him every support
that will enhance his effectiveness and productivity.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Possible support roles:
<ul>
<li>Clerk: someone who maintains files.
<ul>
<li>(This was useful back at the time of the book's writing.)</li>
<li>(But what does files mean? Fixtures and logs? Repro cases from customers?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Toolsmith: maintainer of the tools, which are inevitably highly specialized.</li>
<li>Language lawyer: the consultant who can provide advice on idioms to use. (A code reviewer?)</li>
<li>Copilot / chief of staff: someone who the surgeon communicates with, who can then fan out the
communication to the rest of the team members. This greatly reduces the number of communication
edges connected to the surgeon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How it works: one, or at most two, minds are at work on the problem, ensuring the conceptual
integrity of the work. The rest of the team supports those people.</li>
<li>Differences in judgement among a team of equals takes time to talk through. There are far fewer
such differences on the surgical team.</li>
<li>Brooks argues that this model works, but can only handle small-scoped projects. How can it be
scaled further?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Aristocracy, democracy, and system design (chap 4)</h2>
<ul>
<li>On cathedrals as art: &quot;It is the zenith of a style, the work of artists who had understood and
assimilated all their predecessors' successes, in complete possession of the techniques of their
times, but using them without indiscreet display nor gratuitous feats of skill.&quot;</li>
<li>The design of the church of Reims: &quot;this integrity was achieved by the self-abnegation of eight
generations of builders, each of whom sacrificed some of his ideas so that the whole might be of
pure design. The result proclaims not only the glory of God, but also His power to salvage fallen
men from their pride.&quot;</li>
<li>Fred argues that conceptual integrity is the most important property in system design. More than
the feature set. &quot;Many authors&quot; results in &quot;many uncoordinated ideas.&quot;</li>
<li>Classic tradeoff of whether to adopt another programming language on top of the one you know:
<ul>
<li>&quot;Ease of use is enhanced only if the time gained in functional specification exceeds the time
lost in learning, remembering, and searching manuals.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;The architect of a system, like the architect of a building, is the user's agent.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Good features and ideas that do not integrate with a system's basic concepts are best left out.
If there appear many such important but incompatible ideas, one scraps the whole system and starts
again on an integrated system with different basic concepts.&quot;</li>
<li>Do the architects form a design aristocracy?
<ul>
<li>&quot;If a system is to have conceptual integrity, someone must control the concepts. That is an
aristocracy that needs no apology.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;Setting of external specifications is not more creative work than designing of implementation.&quot;
<ul>
<li>The implementer can set key qualities like the cost-performance ratio.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He describes the architect as the one who carefully designs the &quot;what&quot;, to be handed off to an
implementer who figures the &quot;how&quot;. (Like a PM + dev lead.)</li>
<li>&quot;I observe that the external provision of an architecture enhances, not cramps, the creative style
of an implementing group. They focus at once on the part of the problem no one has addressed, and
inventions begin to flow.&quot;</li>
<li>Fred argues that we should not compromise the system architecture by delegating some of its design
to the implementers, nor should we care if those people have to sit idle while the architecture
completes. Similar to designing a building.</li>
<li>&quot;A widespread horizontal division of labor has been sharply reduced by a vertical division of
labor.&quot;</li>
<li>So: design as much as you can with a single mind, support them, and repeat this for each module
and hope that the coupling is loose.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The second-system effect (chap 5)</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;An architect's first work is apt to be spare and clean. He knows he doesn't know what he's doing,
so he does it carefully and with great restraint.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The second is the most dangerous system a man ever designs.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plan to throw one away (chap 11)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chemical engineers build a pilot plant to debug issues arising during the transition from lab to
factory.</li>
<li>He argues that building a large system the first time will produce a subpar production which
should be rewritten given the lessons of the first attempt.</li>
<li>Job ladders
<ul>
<li>Dual ladders allow ICs to remain ICs</li>
<li>Regarding managers getting more prestige: &quot;to overcome this problem, some laboratories, such as
Bell Labs, abolish all job titles. Each professional employee is a 'member of the technical
staff.'&quot;</li>
<li>Announce transitions from one ladder to the other as a reassignment, not a promotion, to avoid
imbalanced prestige.`</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The surgical team format explicitly allows the senior IC to remain incredibly impactful
<ul>
<li>&quot;The whole notion of organizing surgical-type programming teams is a radical attack on this
problem. It has the effect of making a senior man feel that he does not demean himself when he
builds programs, and it attempts to remove the social obstacles that deprive him of that
creative joy.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;That structure is designed to minimize the number of interfaces. As such, it makes the system
maximally easy to change, and it becomes relatively easy to reassign a whole surgical team to a
different programming task when organizational changes are necessary. It is really the long-run
answer to the problem of flexible organization.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>No silver bullet — essence and accident in software engineering (chap 16)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Thesis: &quot;There is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by
itself promises even one order-of-magnitude improvement within a decade in productivity, in
reliability, in simplicity.&quot;</li>
<li>Essential tasks vs. accidental tasks: accidental tasks include mapping the solution and abstract
concepts to code, and dealing with machine constraints.</li>
<li>Each solution has an &quot;irreducible essence.&quot;</li>
<li>In software, complexity arises because every part is different from every other part, unlike a
building. And a program is capable of a tremendous number of states.</li>
<li>&quot;Many of the classical problems of developing software products derive from this essential
complexity and its nonlinear increases with size.&quot;</li>
<li>Software often has to conform to arbitrary external interfaces because it's the most recent on the
scene, and because it's the most malleable medium.</li>
<li>Complexity in physics vs. complexity in software development:
<ul>
<li>&quot;No such faith comforts the software engineer. Much of the complexity he must master is
arbitrary complexity, forced without rhyme or reason by the many human institutions and systems
to which his interfaces must conform. These differ from interface to interface, and from time to
time, not because of necessity but only because they were designed by different people, rather
than by God.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He argues that past productivity breakthroughs solved accidental difficulties, not essential ones.</li>
<li>There are diminishing productivity gains from each new high-level language.</li>
<li>&quot;The development of a market&quot;: making it easier to use or buy existing software does reduce effort
on the essential problems.</li>
<li>&quot;The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build.&quot;
<ul>
<li>Get a high quality definition through &quot;iterative extraction&quot;: first discovering the right
questions to ask, then the right answers, then the right solution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;It is really impossible for clients, even those working with software engineers, to specify
completely, precisely, and correctly the exact requirements of a modern software product before
having built and tried some versions of the product they are specifying.&quot;</li>
<li>Jones's Point — productivity follows quality
<ul>
<li>Focus on quality, and productivity will follow. Avoiding lumbering systems and design bugs also
avoids schedule disasters late in development.</li>
<li>(This is from chap 17, &quot;No Silver Bullet Refired&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Mythical Man Month after 20 years (chap 19)</h2>
<ul>
<li>&quot;There are many examples of elegant software products designed by a single mind, or by a pair.
Most purely intellectual works such as books or musical compositions are so produced.&quot;</li>
<li>Fred argues that it's hard for software to afford the &quot;straightforward approach&quot; to conceptual
integrity that other creative disciplines use, because software projects grow to become huge, and
there's intense competition that creates urgency.</li>
<li>&quot;Managing large programming projects is qualitatively different from managing small ones, just
because of the number of minds involved.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Recursion of architects&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;For quite large products, one mind cannot do all of the architecture, even after all
implementation concerns have been split off. So it is necessary for the system master architect
to partition the system into subsystems.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;Today I am more convinced than ever. Conceptual integrity is central to produce quality.&quot;</li>
<li>(By architect it sounds like he means product manager: one mind that's responsible for the public
mental model of the product, and serves as the user agent.)</li>
</ul>
