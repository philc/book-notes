<li>Extractive contributions
<ul>
<li>&quot;Extractive contributions are those where the marginal cost of reviewing and merging that
contribution is greater than the marginal benefit to the project's producers.&quot;</li>
<li>Non-extractive contributions: net positive for the producers. Either contributions that are easy
to assimilate, or genuinely high-value work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Argues that OSS should be like a one-way mirror: work is done in public and everything can be
downloaded (consumed), but interacting with the maintainer (and appropriating their attention)

community.</li>
<li>Argues that if individuals are motivated to do something, coordination costs are lower.
<ul>
<li>&quot;Unlike companies — which need to solicit, evaluate, hire, and manage employees — the members
of a commons simply self-organize based on who wants to do the work the most.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Although the commons might not be as profitable as the firm, it's also more resilient, because
the currency of its transactions is the desire to participate, rather than money.&quot;</li>

<li>&quot;Creation is an intrinsic motivator, maintenance usually requires extrinsic motivation.&quot; -
@Balupton.</li>
<li>&quot;A proposed contribution might seem like a good idea on its own, but it's the maintainer who must
tend it, long after the contributor is gone. If the contribution is expensive to maintain, or
doesn't fit the overall vision of the project, they might decide the cost is not worth it.&quot;</li>
<li>Casual contributors
<ul>
<li>They're transactional. The main difference between them and active contributors is that one is
self-oriented, the other community-oriented.</li>
<li>&quot;Casual contributors can be overwhelming, like too many tourists flooding into a town.&quot; High
volume, unpredictable quality.</li>
<li>&quot;A maintainer must manage their relationship with casual contributors in order to retain
enthusiasm for a project.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<li>&quot;Software incurs ongoing maintenance costs, both marginal (costs that are a function of its users)
and temporal (entropy, or costs associated with decay over time).&quot;</li>
<li>OSS is like &quot;free as in puppy.&quot; The software gets older, is less exciting, and has needs that
increase with time.</li>
<li>Tech debt
<ul>
<li>Incremental piece-meal evolution by a myriad of contributors inevitably adds cruft.</li>
<li>OSS is more susceptible to technical debt and scope creep because contributors don't have full

</ul>
</li>
<li>Selling to developers: a product, or a library dependency
<ul>
<li>&quot;Developers are finicky consumers. Not only are they discerning, with a high degree of
sensitivity to slight differences between open source projects, but if they don't like the
options presented to them, they're frequently inspired — and have the ability — to try making
their own version. By contrast, if I need to buy a table for my home but don't like any of my
options, it's unlikely that I'd try to build my own table from scratch.&quot;</li>
<li>And creating something new is intrinsically motivating, so if you're trying to make popular a
new library you've built, you're selling against that dynamic. This dynamic of developer
preferences makes most libraries easily substitutable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;Much of the fatigue that open source developers experience comes not from making their code
public but from expectations around making their code participatory.&quot;</li>
<li>The sole maintainer model has the advantage that it avoids overhead from collaboration
<ul>
<li>Also it's the best model for achieving aesthetic goals like minimalism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maintainers could consider charging for &quot;write access&quot; (the ability to appropriate their
attention) rather than charging for read access, or they could solicit donations. Charging makes
their attention &quot;excludable.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<ul>
<li>The crash in open source that halted the euphoric explosion of information and connectivity:
<ul>
<li>&quot;Our online public lives became too much to handle, causing many of us to shrink back into our
private spheres.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Too many emails made us not want to answer. We were, effectively, DDoSing one another.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;The cycle looks something like this: Open source developers write and publish their code in
public. They enjoy months, maybe years, in the spotlight. But, eventually, popularity offers
diminishing returns. If the value of maintaining code fails to outpace the rewards, many of these
developers quietly retreat to the shadows.&quot;</li>
<li>The popular wisdom is that the solution for maintainer burnout is to bring on more contributors.
OSS is built by communities, right? But these calls for help often attract casual contributors,
creating more — and undesirable — work for the maintainer.</li>
<li>At Github, the author learned that it's a small core that maintains OSS software, not communities.
Most contributors offer only one change to the project.</li>
<li>Maintainers have evolved to be curators.
<ul>
<li>&quot;These maintainers are defined by the need for curation: sifting through the noise of
interactions, such as user requests, bug reports, and feature requests, which compete for their
attention.&quot;</li>
<li>Community interactions are reactive tasks; writing code is a proactive task.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The new problem maintainers now need to solve is how to direct the high volume of interactions,
not how to onboard more people to write code.</li>
<li>Open source transitioned from small internet to big internet
<ul>
<li>OSS creators are like other creators on social media. The audience is large, and the audience
doesn't really help the creator create.</li>
<li>&quot;Creators now reach a much bigger potential audience, but these relationships are fleeting,
one-sided, and often overwhelming.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The structure of an open source project (chap 2)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Community interactions get &quot;noisier&quot; as the project scales — there's less time spent on pushes
and PRs. At some point the maintainer spends more time on non-code work than code work.</li>
<li>To handle the growth, a maintainer must perform increasingly aggressive filtering of the inbound
interactions, or distribute the load by recruiting more maintainers.</li>
<li>Writing code is fun; closing issues and answering questions is generally not as fun.</li>
<li>There are four types of projects:
<ul>
<li>Federations: high contributor growth, high user growth (e.g. Rust)</li>
<li>Clubs: high contributor growth, low user growth (e.g. Astropy)</li>
<li>Toys: low contributor growth, low user growth (e.g. ssh-chat)</li>
<li>Stadiums: low contributor growth, high user growth (e.g. Babel)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Federations
<ul>
<li>Function like a bazaar. Rare, high-functioning project.</li>
<li>Lots of mindshare. Behave like companies, with explicit governance.</li>
<li>Examples: Rust, Node.js, Linux.</li>
<li>Having very few people manage PR merges can become a bottleneck. Node.js experimented with
&quot;optimistic merging.&quot; It gives new devs room to spread their wings and quickly grow their
contributions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clubs
<ul>
<li>Many users are also contributors. Common in niche or very technical tools.</li>
<li>&quot;Clubs may not have a wide reach, but they're loved and built by a group of enthusiasts.&quot;</li>
<li>Sticky (long retention of maintainers), but not magnetic (low attraction of new maintainers).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Toys
<ul>
<li>Personal projects. May be popular and cool, but no one is relying on them. Like tech demos.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stadiums
<ul>
<li>Few maintainers, highly centralized stewardship.</li>
<li>This model is becoming increasingly common.</li>
<li>The structure encourages one-to-many, rather than many-to-many, interaction patterns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's expensive to onboard new maintainers because &quot;maintenance often requires knowledge that isn't
easily externalized to others. So newcomers tend to make casual contributions, instead of pitching
in on more complex tasks around project management.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;By making it easier to contribute, or reducing technical scope, maintainers might move their
projects from a stadium to a federation model.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Centralized communities operate on the basis of limited attention. As proprietors of their
communities, creators must manage user demand on their own. As a result, they tend to rely more
heavily on automation, distributed user-to-user support, and the aggressive elimination of noise.
While all popular projects utilize these approaches, they're a necessity for stadiums.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Roles, incentives, and relationships (chap 3)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Argues that if individuals are motivated to do something, coordination costs are lower.
<ul>
<li>&quot;Unlike companies — which need to solicit, evaluate, hire, and manage employees — the members
of a commons simply self-organize based on who wants to do the work the most.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Although the commons might not be as profitable as the firm, it's also more resilient, because
the currency of its transactions is the desire to participate, rather than money.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Money and open source don't mix.&quot; The presence of an extrinsic motivator displaces the internal
ones, which are key for making the volunteer commons model work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The required ingredients for strangers to collaborate on open source projects:
<ul>
<li>Modular and granular, so that the barrier of entry is low and the scope is small. Similar to the
Unix tools aesthetic.</li>
<li>Low coordination costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keeping coordination costs low is difficult. Coordination work is usually not intrinsically
motivated.
<ul>
<li>(could it be?)</li>
<li>&quot;A maintainer's biggest coordination costs come from reviewing and merging new contributions, so
there's an incentive to keep these costs low. When the costs of coordination outpace the
benefits, the commons breaks down as a useful production model.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The &quot;stadiums&quot;, which are now more common, don't resemble the commons model, or work the same way.
<ul>
<li>&quot;Decentralized communities prioritize work based on abundance of attention: encouraging new
contributors, developing governance processes, and improving engagement and retention. But a
creator prioritizes work based on scarcity of attention: saying no to contributors, closing out
issues, reducing user support. While the commons is tasked with resolving <em>coordination</em> issues,
creators are defined by the need for <em>curation</em>.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Were commons just a temporary historical phenomenon? It's intuitive that big projects would be
driven by a couple of high-leverage engineers — the maintainers — not hundreds of minor
contributors. Maybe in the early days of open source, the population using it was mostly very
capable engineers, given how niche of an activity development software was.)</li>
<li>How platforms broke apart the commons
<ul>
<li>Github created a highway where it was easy to discover what else was out there, and lowered the
barrier to contributing. Also, it made everything look homogenous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;Eternal September&quot;
<ul>
<li>This means: it's like there's a new freshman class joining the community, every day.</li>
<li>&quot;Once America Online (a sort of early highway system itself) began offering access to Usenet,
the service provider exposed the community to a constant stream of new users, creating an
'eternal September.'&quot;</li>
<li>In OSS, &quot;because newcomers have not yet developed commitment to the group and have not yet
learned how the group operates, it is rational for established group members to distrust them.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can you prevent outsiders from derailing your community with requests which don't reflect the
established norms? How can you even label them as outsiders, when OSS is open to all?</li>
<li>&quot;When it's unclear where to draw community boundaries, voting systems don't work very well,
because there's no way to know whether those votes are representative of the total population.&quot;
<ul>
<li>(The author discusses possibly an open forum and thorough discussion process, which is not
dictation from a leader and not a wide vote.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;Creation is an intrinsic motivator, maintenance usually requires extrinsic motivation.&quot; -
@Balupton.</li>
<li>&quot;A proposed contribution might seem like a good idea on its own, but it's the maintainer who must
tend it, long after the contributor is gone. If the contribution is expensive to maintain, or
doesn't fit the overall vision of the project, they might decide the cost is not worth it.&quot;</li>
<li>Only maintainers are interested in the success of the whole project, rather than special
interests.</li>
<li>Author vs. maintainer
<ul>
<li>Original author/contributor. Probably the role with the highest impact to time ratio.</li>
<li>&quot;Handing over the reins of a project is a natural part of a successful project.&quot; - Andrey Petrov</li>
<li>&quot;Some developers love to make things, but they don't like maintaining them. Functionally, the
work required by these two roles is quite different.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The dream is to find someone who likes the role of maintainer, and the author can pair with them
as co-maintainers.</li>
<li>Maintenance costs grows over time, it's not usually intrinsically motivating for developers, and
the extrinsic motivators decrease:
<ul>
<li>&quot;As the project matures, reputational benefits flatten out: after all, the authors are already
known for their affiliation to the project, and spending more time on its maintenance isn't
going to change that. At the same time, reactive work may start to overtake the proactive tasks,
while providing neither intrinsic nor extrinsic benefits. This phase of the project is like
reading through an ever-growing comments section: maintainers experience diminishing returns on
the marginal value of reviewing additional contributions. Eventually, the value derived from new
contributors might not exceed the cost of sifting through contributions.&quot;</li>
<li>Why do maintainers stick with a project if they don't enjoy it? &quot;They might cite feelings of
obligation, community, or helping others as reasons for looking after the project.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;The original author, like a miner who's delved into an ore deposit until it's depleted, may have
reaped all the associated status gains from creating the project, leaving nothing behind for the
next maintainer. There are many more orphaned projects than there are developers clamoring to
become maintainers.&quot;</li>
<li>Active vs. casual contributors
<ul>
<li>&quot;An active contributor is often motivated by a desire for community, but they might have
secondary motivations around reputation and learning. They enjoy the social aspects of the
project and want to feel as if they're 'part of something'&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Casual contributors
<ul>
<li>They're transactional. The main difference between them and active contributors is that one is
self-oriented, the other community-oriented.</li>
<li>&quot;They represent the inverse of the maintainer's linchpin status: many in number, but little
aggregate value.&quot;</li>
<li>Github has created the ideal conditions for the number of casual contributors to increase.</li>
<li>&quot;Casual contributors can be overwhelming, like too many tourists flooding into a town.&quot; High
volume, unpredictable quality.</li>
<li>&quot;A maintainer must manage their relationship with casual contributors in order to retain
enthusiasm for a project.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The work required by software (chap 4)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Greenfield projects are coveted
<ul>
<li>&quot;Most of the work that software developers do is not writing new code, but rather tending to the
code that someone else has written.&quot;</li>
<li>Software regularly gets rewritten every few years, especially if its surrounding context is
changing quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OSS projects can be either static or living.
<ul>
<li>&quot;Code, while it's being traded, appraised, or exchanged, assumes its static form, with all the
properties that we'd expect of a commodity. But once it finds users, code springs to life,
switching to an active state and incurring hidden [support] costs.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OSS is like &quot;free as in puppy.&quot; The software gets older, is less exciting, and has needs that
increase with time.</li>
<li>&quot;In reality, a widely used project makes itself unforkable because it's become more than just the
code.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Software incurs ongoing maintenance costs, both marginal (costs that are a function of its users)
and temporal (entropy, or costs associated with decay over time).&quot;</li>
<li>Does software have zero marginal cost? Yes, in its static state. But in its active state, the user
support required for additional users is a substantial cost.</li>
<li>Temporal costs
<ul>
<li>&quot;It's not just code itself that requires maintenance either, but all the supporting knowledge
that surrounds it. When code changes, its documentation must also change. The most upvoted
answers on a Q&amp;A site eventually become outdated and incorrect. Programming books and videos
eventually require revisions.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Technical debt
<ul>
<li>Incremental piece-meal evolution by a myriad of contributors inevitably adds cruft.
<ul>
<li>&quot;Code is 'cleanest' when it's first released, because that's the time at which developers are
thinking about the project holistically and writing it from scratch.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OSS is more susceptible to technical debt and scope creep because contributors don't have full
context on the project.</li>
<li>Test infrastructure and test suites are particularly prone to technical debt, in the form of
coarse tests, flaky tests, slow tests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adapting to user needs
<ul>
<li>User needs change over time and remaining relevant requires changing to meet those needs,
sometimes with a completely different approach.</li>
<li>Sometimes it's best for both the maintainer and the ecosystem to deprecate a package and stop
maintaining it, so newer solutions have room to thrive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;A developer might gain reputational benefits from creating a popular project, but those benefits
are usually short-lived compared to the long-term costs of maintenance.&quot;
<ul>
<li>This creates an ongoing tension between producer and consumer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On dependencies
<ul>
<li>&quot;Developers are finicky consumers. Not only are they discerning, with a high degree of
sensitivity to slight differences between open source projects, but if they don't like the
options presented to them, they're frequently inspired — and have the ability — to try making
their own version. By contrast, if I need to buy a table for my home but don't like any of my
options, it's unlikely that I'd try to build my own table from scratch.&quot;
<ul>
<li>And creating something new is intrinsically motivating, so if you're trying to make popular a
new library you've built, you're selling against that dynamic. This dynamic of developer
preferences makes most libraries easily substitutable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;If open source code is like infrastructure, we want to measure its value based on a combination
of dependencies (who uses the code?) and substitutability (if this code disappeared, how hard
would it be to replace?).&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Managing the costs of production (chap 5)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Public goods: &quot;The two main criteria that distinguish a public good are that it must be
non-rivalrous and non-excludable. Non-rivalrous means that the goods do not dwindle in supply as
more people consume them; non-excludability means that the good is made available to all
citizens.&quot;</li>
<li>Argues that public goods require governments to produce them in the physical world. Online, they
can be produced by individuals (e.g. OSS, blogs), because they are cheap to make and people have
intrinsic motivation to to do so — they want to express themselves, and so they are OK giving
them away for free. It's like a neighborhood art expo, or talent show, or how people put up
Christmas lights for free.
<ul>
<li>We are motivated to share what we make and have that part of us understood by others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maybe we're over-producing software and blog posts, such that now consumers treat it like
everything is highly substitutable and worth nothing, such that they demand and expect things of
the producers that they have no real right to.</li>
<li>Participation
<ul>
<li>&quot;Much of the fatigue that open source developers experience comes not from making their code
public but from expectations around making their code participatory.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Open source code, in static state, is a public good, meaning that it is both non-excludable and
non-rivalrous. Like my neighbor's Christmas decorations, if it can be consumed at nearly zero
marginal cost, we should just let people have it.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The <em>production</em> of open source code, however, functions more like a commons — meaning that it
is non-excludable and rivalrous — where <em>attention</em> is the rivalrous resource. Maintainers
can't stop users from bidding for their attention.&quot;
<ul>
<li>And maintainers allocate a limited amount of attention to a project, and so users must compete
for it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is akin to executives: they must allocate their limited attention carefully, and if any
employee or customer can demand and direct their attention, they will be less effective and
suboptimally leveraged by the firm they work for.</li>
<li>One-way mirror
<ul>
<li>Argues that OSS should be like a one-way mirror: work is done in public and everything can be
downloaded (consumed), but interacting with the maintainer (and appropriating their attention)
cannot be done by random viewers in the stadium — only by trusted members of the project's
community.</li>
<li>When attention is being appropriated, the producer must ensure it's net positive.</li>
<li>&quot;Extractive contributions are those where the marginal cost of reviewing and merging that
contribution is greater than the marginal benefit to the project's producers.&quot;
<ul>
<li>E.g. PRs that are unwieldy and difficult to review; events which require too much resources
from the producers.</li>
<li>&quot;The most common forms of extractive contributions are comments, questions, and feature
requests.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Sometimes feature requests, questions, and high-energy discussions lead the project in new,
worthwhile directions, but quite often they're simply a waste of time and energy for everyone
involved.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>E.g. a contribution which translates docs seems additive, but now it's permanent overhead as the
primary docs evolve. Will the original translator commit to maintaining them?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adding more contributors doesn't obviously help the situation of high-demand, because 1)
extractive contributions are negative ROI and shouldn't be reviewed by anyone, and 2) demand tends
to expand to consume all resources.</li>
<li>Non-extractive contributions: net positive for the producers. Either contributions that are easy
to assimilate, or genuinely high-value work.</li>
<li>&quot;This fear of invoking public wrath leads maintainers to feel pressured to review contributions,
even when they are extractive.&quot;
<ul>
<li>It's socially difficult to discard the needs, input, and contributions from users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;The programming language Clojure is an example of an open source project that explicitly draws
boundaries around participation. Rich Hickey, its author, is known for his top-down approach to
governance.&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;Authority comes along with authorship… I don't know why that is no longer obvious. Thinking
otherwise yields a broken economic model, where people are not entitled to control over the
products of their own labor, and thus are without control over their livelihood.&quot; - Rich Hickey</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maintainer attention on a project will decline over time, because the reputational benefits come
early and thus motivation declines afterward.</li>
<li>&quot;Filtering out&quot; contributors who aren't motivated enough by adding friction:
<ul>
<li>Some projects &quot;seem to deliberately enjoy not being on GitHub, because it makes their projects
harder to get to.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some maintainers desire &quot;n=1&quot; — only one contributor — and won't accept PRs, although they make
take inspiration from them. N=1 lets them keep the whole project in their heads and avoid any
overhead resulting from collaboration.
<ul>
<li>&quot;I won't use your code. I love that people send me ideas, but I actually enjoy coding… so I
will gladly take your suggestions, though I will write it myself.&quot; (Roberto Ierusalimschy,
author of Lua, about PRs for Lua)</li>
<li>The sole maintainer model makes it possible to achieve aesthetic goals like minimalism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;User-to-user systems are a way of distributing costs without appropriating attention from
producers.&quot;
<ul>
<li>John Resig: &quot;The very first person I brought on to the jQuery project wasn't another developer
to help contribute… it was someone to help manage our community.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maintainers could consider charging for &quot;write access&quot; (the ability to appropriate their
attention) rather than charging for read access, or they could solicit donations. Charging makes
their attention &quot;excludable.&quot;
<ul>
<li>&quot;One popular project hosts regular 'office hours' with its highest-paying supporters as a perk
of sponsorship.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Argues that social status is the typical reward currency for creators, but open source developers
aren't good at accumulating that reward, because their platform of choice (GitHub) doesn't help
them amass popularity, in the same way that Twitter or YouTube does.</li>
<li>Example from Django: using donations to fund a &quot;fellowship program&quot; for someone to do the admin
work of triaging PRs and issues in the Django issue tracker. &quot;In this case paying for the work
that Django contributors weren't otherwise incentivized to do was hugely helpful to the project.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some large platforms are becoming more like one-way mirrors — content is broadcasted, but there's
little room for or expectations of a dialog. E.g. Instagram stories, newsletters, podcasts.</li>
<li>&quot;Group chats are the embodiment of Ostrom's thesis: a way of drawing boundaries around one's
community, excluding extractive contributors, in order to allow for higher-context interactions.
They, too, are an adaptive measure to the problem of over-participation.&quot;</li>
<li>Something Awful forums put a paywall in place before activating your account, if you wanted to
post. Apparently, this was very effective at &quot;keeping idiots out of the community.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;We're moving toward a future where rewards are heavily influenced by the quality of one's
audience more than its size.&quot;</li>
