* Gems
  * On setting goals: "We don't care about squeezing out the last drops by setting ambitious goals. Those
    drops taste sour."
  * Comfy's cool: rather than always embracing discomfort, "if you listen to your discomfort and back off from
    what's causing it, you're more likely to find the right path. We've been in that place many times over the
    years at Basecamp."
  * On financial controls, bureaucracy, and heavyweight process
    * They guard so many things, but all too often they fail to protect what's both most vulnerable and most
      precious: their employees' time and attention.
  * Don't let others schedule your time: If you don't own the vast majority of your time, it's impossible to
    be calm. You'll always be stressed out, feeling robbed of the ability to actually do your job.
  * What you want is the "oblivious joy of focus." Not to be in touch, not to be constantly reprioritizing
    your work to ensure it's maximally relevant and aligned.
  * "The best companies aren't families. They're supporters of families."
* It's crazy t work
  * 1) the workday is being sliced into tiny, fleeting work moments by an onslaught of distractions.
  * 2) An unhealthy obsession with growth at any cost sets towering, unrealistic expectations that stress
    people out.
  * "People can't get work done at work anymore" because of distractions, so work inevitably bleeds into home
    life.
  * "The answer isn't more hours, it's less bullshit. Less waste, not more production. And far fewer
    distractions, less always-on anxiety, and avoiding stress."
  * "It's time to give people the uninterrupted time that great work demands."
  * "Calm company"
    * This is their goal for Basecamp. There's no ego-driven goals.
  * "The modern workplace is sick. Chaos should not be the natural state at work. Anxiety isn't a prerequisite
    for progress. Sitting in meetings all day isn't required for success. These are all perversions of work
    --side effects of broken models."
  * "Calm is more independence, less interdependence."
* Your company is a product
  * Your company is the thing that makes those products. That's why your company should be your best product."
  * Companies should be malleable, to afford iteration, just like we try to make our products and our eng
    systems malleable.
  * A company is like software. It has to be usable. It has bugs, places where the company crashes because of
    bad organizational design or cultural oversights.
* Bury the hustle
  * The human experience is so much more than 24/7 hustle to the max.
  * It's also just bad advice. You're not very likely to find that key insight or breakthrough idea north of
    the 14th hour in the day. Creativity, progress, and impact do not yield to brute force.
* Happy pacifists
  * Business literate is about fighting and dominating. It leads to zero-sum thinking.
  * At Basecamp, "we don't have imperial ambitions."
  * "What's our market share? Don't know, don't care. It's irrelevant. Do we have enough customers paying us
    enough money to cover our costs and generate a profit? Yes. Is that number increasing every year? Yes.
    That's good enough for us."
  * Comparisons
    * "Comparison is the death of joy." - Mark Twain
    * "We don't compare. What others do has no bearing on what we're able to do, what we want to do, or what
      we choose to do. There's no chase at Basecamp, no rabbit to pursue. Just a deep satisfaction with doing
      our very best work as measured by our happiness and our customers' purchases."
* Our goal: no goals
  * "No customer-count goals, no sales goals, no retention goals, no revenue goals, no specific profitability
    goals."
  * Don't care about squeezing out the last drops by setting ambitious goals. Those drops taste sour.
  * "There are four quarters to a year. Forty to a decade. Every one of them has to produce, exceed, and beat
    EXPECTATIONS." (He assumes all numbers that get put into goals are arbitrary).
  * It's hard enough to build a long-lasting sustainable business with happy employees. So why impose some
    arbitrary number to loom over your ob, salary, bonus, and kid's college fund?
  * How about no targets, no goals?
  * "if you must have a goal, how about just staying in business? Or serving your customers well? or being a
    delightful place to work?"
    * I.e. goals which are already aligned with what you want to do, but which aren't quantified and don't
      have any teeth.
* Don't change the world
  * Founders are infatuated with disruption. Aiming for a regular impact lifts burden off of your shoulders,
    letting you be satisfied with normal work efforts.
* Make it up as you go
  * At Basecamp, there's no 1 year plan. The product plan has just a few weeks' horizon.
  * 6 week horizon lets you change your mind often; "it's a huge relief."
  * "Much corporate anxiety comes from the realization that the company has been doing the wrong thing, but
    it's too late to change direction because of the 'Plan'."
* Comfy's cool
  * Going deeper into where you're already comfortable can produce gains and mastery. Most companies don't
    need unnecessarily painful breadth.
  * "If you get into the habit of suppressing all discomfort, you're going to lose yourself."
  * "On the contrary, if you listen to your discomfort and back off from what's causing it, you're more likely
    to find the right path. We've been in that place many times over the years at Basecamp."
  * "That's how we ended up throwing out individual negotiations and differences in pay, and going with a
    simpler system." (I wonder what this simple comp system is."
  * "Being comfortable in your zone is essential to being calm."
* 8's enough, 40's plenty
  * "Most people don't actually have 8 hours a day to work, they have a couple of hours. The rest of the day
    is stolen from them by meetings, conference calls, and other distractions."
  * If you can't fit everything you want to do within 40 hours per week, you need to get better at picking
    what to do.
* Protectionism
  * On financial controls, beaureacracy, and heavyweight process
    * They guard so many things, but all too often they fail to protect what's both most vulnerable and most
      precious: their employees' time and attention.
  * Time and attention are best spent in large bills, if you will, not spare coins and small change.
    * A high quality hour is "1x60", not "2x30", "4x15".
* Effective > productive
  * When people focus on productivity, they end up focusing on being busy. Filling every moment with something
    to do. There's always more to do!
  * We don't believe in busyness at Basecamp. We believe in effectiveness. How little can we do? How much can
    we cut out? Instead of adding to-dos, we add to-don'ts.
* The Outwork Myth
  * Assertion: nobody is successful just because they put in more time than the next person. It was something
    else: luck, smarter technique, ...
* Office hours
  * Work doesn't happen at work any more. THe ideal places that work really gets done are any kind of
    interruption-free zone.
  * On pinging experts
    * THe person with the question needed something and they go tit. THe person with the answer was doing
      something else and had to stop. That's rarely a fair trade.
    * It ragments the expert's workday. It's the productivity curse of being an expert. Control this
      productivity loss by containing it within office hours.
  * While office hours increase latency of help, it often can wait. And it's a model that explicitly aligns
    with a calm work environment.
* Calendar Tetris
  * At Basecamp, all calendars are private, which makes it much higher friction to get on someone's calendar.
  * "If you make it easy for someone to invite five other people to a meeting -- because software can find the
    open slot that works for everyone --then meetings with six people will proliferate."
  * Taking someone's time should be a pain in the ass. Taking many people's time should be so cumbersome that
    most people won't even bother to try it unless it's really important. Meetings should be a last resort,
    especially big ones.
  * If you don't own the vast majority of your time, it's impossible to be calm. You'll always be stressed
    out, feeling robbed of the ability to actually do your job.
* The presence prison
  * The only way to know work is getting done is by looking at the actual work. Not if they're sitting at
    their desk.
  * Indicators which reveal when you're online and available invite others to interrupt you.
* I'll get back to you whenever
  * Basecamp has a culture of eventual response. Don't check and reply to email for long stretches of time, to
    favor your primary job over communication.
* FOMO? JOMO!
  * "Fuck that. People should be missing out! Most people should miss out on most things most of the time.
    That's we try to encourage at Basecamp JOMO -- the joy of missing out."
  * "It's JOMO that lets you turn off the firehose of informationa nd chatter and interruptions to actually
    get the right shit done."
  * It's a fool's errand to think you can know everything that's going on at the company.
  * The solution for status? Monthly snippets, writen by the tech lead, distilled and curated to be broad
    appeal and useful.
  * It's "the oblivious joy of focus."
* We're not family
  * Calling a company a family is manipulation to the employees.
    * "By invoking the image of the family, the valor of doing whatever it takes naturally follows. You're not
      just working long nights or skipping a vacation to further the bottom line; no, no, you're doing this
      for the family. Such a blunt emotional appeal is only needed if someone is trying to make you forget
      about your rational self-interest."
  * The best companies aren't families. They're supporters of families.
* Low-hanging fruit can still be out of reach
  * Beware thinking an unfamiliar task or fist-of hire will obviously produce easy, low-hanging fruit without
    a ton of investment.
  * The next time you ask an employee to go pick some low-hanging fruit, stop yourself. Respect the work
    you've never done before.
* Out of whack
  * If it's easier for work to claim a Sunday than for life to borrow a Thursday, there ain't no balance.
  * Work shouldn't be able to claim weekends, or time past 5pm.
* Hire the work, not the resume
  * "We do better work, broader work, and more considered work when the team reflects the diversity of our
    customer base. 'Not exactly what we already have' is a quality in itself."
  * Method: put a project in front of the candidate, pay them $1500, and have them work on it for a week.
    Forget the resume; who knows which part of the nike.come redesign they actually did. This gives more
    people a chance, and it avoids hiring an imaginary person.
* Ignore the talent war
  * "Talent isn't worth fighting over. It's not a fixed, scarce rseource that either you have or you don't. It
    rarely even transplants all that well. Someone who's a superstar at one company often turns out to be
    completely ineffectual at another. Don't go to war over talent." Instead, get it through growing and
    nurturing.
  * "We've found nurturing untapped potential is far more exhilarating than finding someone who's already at
    their peak."
* Don't negotiate salaries
  * It's a ritual that no one likes, and often leaves you uncertain about whether you got a fair deal or
    could've gotten more. Free your employees from this tress.
  * Basecamp's method:
    * Salaries
      * 5 levels per department/role.
      * Everyone in the same level is paid the same.
      * They pay top 10% of market, and track market each year by issuing raises.
      * To increase comp greatly means increasing your level.
    * Pay at SF rates even though their team is distributed, to combat the appeal of FANG.
    * "We don't pay traditional bonuses at Basecamp, either, so our salaries are benchmarked against other
      companies' salaries plus bonus packages. We used to do bonsues many years ago, but we found that they
      were quickly treated as expected salary, so if they ever dipped, people felt like they got a demotion."
    * They pay 25% of the grwoth in EBITDA of that year out to the current employees.
    * (Seems to me like they give competitive salary and no stock, so their packages are 1/2 of what Google or
      FB will pay.)
