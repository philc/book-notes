# Bogleheads Guide to Invvesting - Mel Lindauer

## Gems

* Confidence-raising emotions are great for achieving and starting enterprises, but a poor and
  dangerous tool for investing.
* (I didn't take many notes because this book contained mostly basic material I was already familiar
  with).

## Start early and invest regularly (chap 2)

* The duration of compounding dominates the contribution size. "Start the compounding early."

## Know what you're buying part 1 (chap 3)

* Why buy bonds? They have how correlation with stocks, so they act as a stabilizing force for the
  portfolio.

## Know what you're buying part 2 (chap 4)

* Fund of funds: a single virtual fund that meets a desired asset allocation. Like Vanguard Life
  Strategy fund, and other life cycle funds.
* On annuities
  * "Because of their high costs and surrender fees, and the decreased tax benefits of annuities in
    relation to more tax-efficient investments available, annuities really don't have much to offer
    most investors. It's probably safe to say that most annuities are *sold* and not *bought*."
* Mutual funds settle once per day. ETFs can be transacted continuously throughout the day, like a
  stock.

## How much do you need to save? (chap 6)

* Inflation: expect 3-4% per year.
* Don't expect the historical average (7% return) on your portfolio as you get close to retirement
  * "Younger investors tend to be more aggressive by holding a higher percentage of their portfolio
    in equities. As a result, they should expect a higher rate of return for taking on this
    additional risk. Then, as we get older and closer to retirement, we need to get more
    conservative. This means we'll be taking on less risk by lowering the percentage of equities in
    our portfolio and increasing the percentage of bonds, so we should expect lower returns."

## Keep it simple (chap 7)

* Make index funds the core, or all, of your portfolio.
* "It's common for actively managed funds to have great before-tax returns and not-so-great
  after-tax returns, due to the trading that goes on in actively managing the funds. For that
  reason, we recommend keeping any actively managed funds in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts."

## Asset allocation (chap 8)

* Risk = standard deviation of the expected return.
* Risk and return are related.
* Modern portfolio theory: "A mixture of volatile noncorrelated securities could result in a
  *portfolio* with lower volatility and possibly higher return."
* If you think you will lose sleep in a bear market, add more bonds. If you have never been through
  a bear market, add another 10-20% bonds, as insurance.
* "If you decide to add one or more sector funds, we suggest that your total allocation to sector
  funds not exceed 10 percent of the equity portion of your portfolio. Jack Bogle had this to say:
  'You could go your entire life without ever owning a sector fund and probably never miss it.'"
* High-yield (junk) bonds: not recommended. Bonds are supposed to provide safety.
  * "We believe that for investors willing to give up the safety of traditional good-quality bonds,
    it's more efficient (higher return per unit of risk) to invest in stocks, rather than high-yield
    bonds."

## Costs matter (chap 9)

* "Turnover refers to the amount of buying and selling activity that's done by the fund manager in a
  given year. A turnover of 100 percent indicates that the manager buys and sells the average stock
  in the fund portfolio every 12 months."
* Low turnover funds tend to outperform high-turnover because turnover is expensive, aside from the
  tax implications.
* There's a non-linear relationship between the rate of return and the final asset value, due to
  compounding. Which is why expenses are so negatively impactful to one's final return.

## Taxes part 1 (chap 10)

* Stock dividends are historically 35% of the total return from investing in equities.
* The federal tax rate on qualified dividends is roughly 15-20% less than income tax rates.
* "The lower rates on qualified dividends increase the tax-efficiency of stocks relative to bonds
  whose yield is taxed at ordinary income tax rates."
  * "For this reason, and the fact that stocks benefit from the lower capital gains tax rates, we
    generally recommend placing stocks in taxable accounts and bonds in tax-advantaged accounts."
* "Municipal bond sand bond funds generally provide lower yields than comparable taxable bonds."

## Taxes part 2 (chap 11)

* 401K pre-tax contributions, $17.5K limit; often there's employer matching.
* IRA
  * Traditional: contributions can be deductible. Gains are taxed.
  * Roth: contributions are taxed, the growth is not taxed.
    * No required minimum distribution at age 70.5. THis allows continued growth for the benefit of
      heirs.
    * Heirs pay no income tax on proceeds, as they do with traditional IRAs.
  * (Describes back door Roth)

## Diversification (chap 12)

* Dimensions of diversification:
  * Bonds vs. equities
  * Short, medium, long-term bonds
  * Small, medium, large-cap equities

## Performance chasing and market timing are hazardous to your wealth (chap 13)

* (Dunking on financial newsletters, shows, magazines as having no predictive signal. If they did,
  they would be private).
* Argues that even 10 year performance window of a mutual fund does not predict future performance,
  based on studies.
* "Since the 1960s, the average return of the top-20 mutual funds in each decade as less than the
  market index return in the next decade."
* Market timing is a complete myth. No one has done it reliably and successfully.

## How to manage a windfall (chap 15)

* "This is no time to go it alone."
* "Get your advice and your investments/insurance from different sources. A good place to begin
  seeking advice is from a CPA who does not sell investment products."

## Do I need an advisor (chap 16)

* "I helped put two children through Harvard -- my broker's children." -- Michael LeBoeuf
* Keywords to search for: fee-only advisor, "Chartered Financial Advisor (CFA)."
* Most aligned model: a one-time fee, or hourly.

## Track your progress and rebalance as necessary (chap 17)

* Rebalancing: bring portfolio back to target allocation as time passes.
* "Don't let the market dictate the makeup of your portfolio."
* Simulations have shown that rebalancing doesn't improve long-term return, but it does
  substantially lower variance over time.
* "Asset classes have had a tendency to revert to the mean (RTM) over time. By rebalancing, you're
  selling a portion of your winning asset classes before they revert to the mean (drop in price) and
  you're buying more of your underperforming asset classes when their prices are lower, before they
  revert to the mean (increase in value)."
  * Although some don't believe in RTM behavior for an asset: if the market is a random walk, each
    change in price should be independent from the others.

## Tune out the "noise" (chap 18)

* "Wall street wants you to believe they are there to make money for you, but their true purpose is
  to make money from you."
* The simplicity of a sound investing strategy creates a problem for investment media: it's simple
  and boring. So they churn out "investment pornography" instead.
* "All forecasting is noise."
* If you knew what to pick, would you actually spend your time writing a stock market newsletter,
  telling people what's going to happen?

## Mastering your investments means mastering your emotions (chap 19)

* Confidence-raising emotions are great for achieving and starting enterprises, but a poor and
  dangerous tool for investing.
* In the short term, ups and downs are random; no smart people can forecast them.
* Overconfidence
  * "Women tend to earn better returns than men because they trade less and take more prudent risks.
    Men, on the other hand, are taught that it's their role to take action and solve problems. The
    problem is that taking bold action to solve investment problems usually creates worse problems."

## Making your money last longer than you do (chap 20)

* "The last suit we wear doesn't need any pockets."
* "Stock market returns go through long periods of feast and famine."
* "Believing you can withdraw 10 percent per year and not run out of money is akin to the idea that
  you can put your head in an oven, your feet in a freezer, and consider yourself comfortable on
  average."
  * Withdraw 4-5% of your portfolio each year after age 65.

## Protect your assets by being well-insured (chap 21)

* "To be a successful investor requires being a good risk manager. Managing risk means having a plan
  to cover the downside. THat's what insurance is all about -- damage control to prevent the
  unforeseen from smashing your nest egg."
* "Only insure against the big catastrophes and disasters that you can't afford to pay for out of
  pocket. The cheapest insurance is self-insurance."
* "Carry the largest possible deductibles you can afford. The larger the deductible, the more you
  are self-insuring and the cheaper the premium will be."
* "We don't believe in mixing investing with insurance. Insurance is for protection and investing is
  for wealth building. Don't confuse or mix the two." E.g. policies that build cash with time.
* "You need to protect yourself against potential lawsuits that could wipe you out. In our litigious
  society, it's an absolute must. Purchase a personal liability umbrella policy of at least $1
  million, or an amount to cover your total net worth. Umbrella policies are relatively cheap for
  the amount of protection and usually sold in $1 million increments."
