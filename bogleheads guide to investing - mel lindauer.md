* (I didn't take many notes because this book contained mostly basic material I was already familiar
  with).
* Start early and invest regularly (chap 2)
  * The duration of compounding dominates the contribution size. "Start the compounding early."
* Know what you're buying part 1 (chap 3)
  * Why buy bonds? They have how correlation with stocks, so they act as a stabilizing force for the
    portfolio.
* Know what you're buying part 2 (chap 4)
  * Fund of funds: a single virtual fund that meets a desired asset allocation. Like Vanguard Life
    Strategy fund, and other life cycle funds.
  * On annuities
    * "Because of their high costs and surrender fees, and the decreased tax benefits of annuities
      in relation to more tax-efficient investments available, annuities really don't have much to
      offer most investors. It's probably safe to say that most annuities are *sold* and not
      *bought*."
  * Mutual funds settle once per day. ETFs can be transacted continuously throughout the day, like a
    stock.
* How much do you need to save? (chap 6)
  * Inflation: expect 3-4% per year.
  * Don't expect the historical average (7% return) on your portfolio as you get close to retirement
    * "Younger investors tend to be more aggressive by holding a higher percentage of their portfolio
      in equities. As a result, they should expect a higher rate of return for taking on this
      additional risk. Then, as we get older and closer to retirement, we need to get more
      conservative. This means we'll be taking on less risk by lowering the percentage of equities in
      our portfolio and increasing the percentage of bonds, so we should expect lower returns."
* Keep it simple (chap 7)
  * Make index funds the core, or all, of your portfolio.
  * "It's common for actively managed funds to have great before-tax returns and not-so-great
  after-tax returns, due to the trading that goes on in actively managing the funds. For that
  reason, we recommend keeping any actively managed funds in tax-deferred or tax-free accounts."
* Asset allocation (chap 8)
  * Risk = standard deviation of the expected return.
  * Risk and return are related.
  * Modern portfolio theory: "A mixture of volatile noncorrelated securities could result in a
    *portfolio* with lower volatility and possibly higher return."
  * If you think you will lose sleep in a bear market, add more bonds. If you have never been
    through a bear market, add another 10-20% bonds, as insurance.
  * "If you decide to add one or more sector funds, we suggest that your total allocation to sector
    funds not exceed 10 percent of the equity portion of your portfolio. Jack Bogle had this to say:
    'You could go your entire life without ever owning a sector fund and probably never miss it.'"
  * High-yield (junk) bonds: not recommended. Bonds are supposed to provide safety.
    * "We believe that for investors willing to give up the safety of traditional good-quality
      bonds, it's more efficient (higher return per unit of risk) to invest in stocks, rather than
      high-yield bonds."
* Costs matter (chap 9)
  * "Turnover refers to the amount of buying and selling activity that's done by the fund manager
    in a given year. A turnover of 100 percent indicates that the manager buys and sells the
    average stock in the fund portfolio every 12 months."
  * Low turnover funds tend to outperform high-turnover because turnover is expensive, aside from
    the tax implications.
  * There's a non-linear relationship between the rate of return and the final asset value, due to
    compounding. Which is why expenses are so negatively impactful to one's final return.
* Taxes part 1 (chap 10)
  * Stock dividends are historically 35% of the total return from investing in equities.
  * The federal tax rate on qualified dividends is roughly 15-20% less than income tax rates.
  * "The lower rates on qualified dividends increase the tax-efficiency of stocks relative to bonds
    whose yield is taxed at ordinary income tax rates."
    * "For this reason, and the fact that stocks benefit from the lower capital gains tax rates, we
      generally recommend placing stocks in taxable accounts and bonds in tax-advantaged accounts."
  * "Municipal bond sand bond funds generally provide lower yields than comparable taxable bonds."
