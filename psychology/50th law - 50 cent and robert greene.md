# 50th Law - 50 Cent, Robert Greene

## Intro

* Where did fear come from? People used to fear things which are powerful and deserved fear, like
  nature, war, and plague. Now in their absence, we instead have a general fearful anxiety about
  things which are not real and powerful, like our status among our peers. It's a waste.
* You can deal with fear passively, by avoiding conflict, or actively, by embracing conflict.
* Some are forced into using the active mode for much of their lives, e.g. Pursuit of Happyness,
  living in poverty, or being at war. And this develops strength.
* The key to fearlessness is to assume the active mode in dealing with your fears. Hard decisions,
  confronting people, looking out for your own interests: this hard work must become second nature.
* This is the physics that all fearless types must employ: the continual ratcheting up of
  self-belief and energy when facing negative or impossible circumstances. This was the pioneer
  spirit in America in the 1800s.
* Fifty's reality: "he never knew his father, and his mother was murdered when he was eight. He
  quickly developed the habit of not depending on other people to protect or shelter him. This meant
  that in every encounter in life in which he felt fear, he could turn only to himself."
* Qualities of fearless types, like Fifty:
  * They find that the chaos of the times suits their temperament.
  * They embrace the advances in technology that make others secretly fearful.
  * They let go of the past and create their own business model.
  * They do not give in to the conservative spirit that haunts corporate America.
* 50th law: be fearless.
* You need to be bold to be fearless. Boldness -- not conforming to a crowd -- flies in the face of
  deep fears we have as social animals.
* A brush with death reminds us of the shortness of life. It provides a helpful urgency and energy.
* At some point you will discover the power of "reversal" -- overcoming the negative of a particular
  fear leads to a positive quality, like self-reliance, patience, self-confidence. Like a high after
  a workout.

## See things for what they are -- Intense Realism (chap 1)

* "The Hustler's Eye": words from "Truth" (a hustler acquaintance): you must have your eye fixed on
  reality and sharpened to a razor's edge. The harsh world of hustling does this for you... or you
  die.
* Once Fifty got a music contract, he observed the environment carefully and quickly realized,
  through the initial glamour, that he was a pawn in their game. They didn't care about him and
  would discard him once his heat dissipated.
* "Reality is my drug. The more I have of it, the more power I get and the higher I feel." - Fifty.
  * Relying not on other people, but on himself and the "hustler's eye."
* A realist's eye can be applied to people and to business situations. You want to study people and
  try to understand some of the mystery behind how they act and how they will respond. This will
  give you knowledge and power. In business, you want to really see why you're not growing as fast
  as you can, and what changes are rippling through the industry and what dangers loom around the
  corner.
* "Having clarity about where you are headed, what people are up to, and what is happening in the
  world around you will translate into confidence and power, a sensation of lightness" (rather than
  it feeling onerous to be a realist).
* He criticizes escapism, distractions produced by the entertainment industry, and politics, for
  their effect of reducing our focus on pragmatics and the realities in front of us.
* Having a "beginner's mindset" is a powerful tool for studying reality. It's what you had as a kid,
  when you were ignorant to everything and studied the world carefully. "Everything was a source of
  wonder."
* Exercise: "Just imagine for a day that you do not know anything, that what you believe could be
  completely false. Let go of your preconceptions and even your most cherished beliefs. Experiment.
  Force yourself to hold the opposite opinion or see the world through your enemy's eyes. Listen to
  the people around you with more attentiveness. See everything as a source for education -- even
  the most banal encounters. Imagine that the world is still full of mystery."
* "If you cannot observe something firsthand, get reports that are more direct and less filtered, or
  vary the sources so you can see the terrain from several sides. Get a fingertip feel for
  everything going on in your environment."
* When studying people, push deeper until you get to the root cause and motivations of people.
* In being a realist, you must understand that "everyone is after power, and that to get it we all
  occasionally manipulate and even deceive. This is human nature and there is no shame in it. You
  don't take people's maneuvers personally; you merely try to defend or advance yourself."
* "Self detachment": every few weeks, engage in a ritual of self analysis. Detach and look at
  yourself from the third person (like the machine operator idea from Principles), to assess who you
  are and where you're headed. Look at your most recent actions as if they were the maneuvers of
  another person. Are you impressed and threatened, or do you see exploitable weakness? Only use
  detachment this when analyzing, not in the moment, because that will erode your self-confidence.

## Make everything your own -- self-reliance (chap 2)

* "You came into this life with the only real possessions that ever matter -- your body, the time
  that you have to live, your energy, the thoughts and ideas unique to you, and your autonomy. But
  over the years you tend to give all of this away. You spend years working for others -- they own
  you during that period. You get needlessly caught up in people's games and battles, wasting energy
  and time that you will never get back. You come to respect your own ideas less and less, listening
  to experts, conforming to conventional opinions."
* Hurricane Carter, maintaining control while in prison: "he refused to have the usual
  entertainments in his cell -- television, radio, pornographic magazines. He knew he would grow
  dependent on these weak pleasures and this would give the wardens something to take away from
  him."
* Beware the crutches that our culture offers you -- it creates dependence. Especially
  entertainment.
* If you must be in a situation out of your control, use it for your advancement. Vanderbilt,
  working for his father's shipping business, which he hated: "Cornelius was a willful, ambitious
  child, and so in his mind he made the following determination: within a couple of years he was
  going to start his own shipping enterprise. This simple decision altered everything. Now this job
  was an urgent apprenticeship."
* You are unique, so don't overly rely on what others have done in your field. Don't be afraid of
  some approach suited to you.

## Turn shit into sugar -- optimism (chap 3)

* Mentally framing a negative event as a blessing in disguise makes it easier for you to move
  forward. It is a kind of mental alchemy, transforming shit into sugar. This was the case with 50s
  assassination attempt, and being dropped from the labels.
* We live in a prosperous society, and over time we develop the belief that we're entitled to all
  that we have. When setbacks occur, "we either blame other people or we blame ourselves. In both
  cases, we lose valuable time and become unnecessarily emotional."
* Great victories, like Washington's desperate guerrilla warfare against the British, are won only
  out of dark, low moments. Treat them as opportunities to think differently. Moments like these
  bring out our creativity and boldness.
* "By simply embracing the moment as something positive and necessary you have already converted it
  into gold."
* Taking advantage of turning points in taste to lift you up, rather than threaten you: "People fear
  the new. You can turn this into an opportunity by being the first to give some meaning to this
  apparent disorder, establishing it as a positive value." Younger generations will always react
  against the values and preferences of the older generation; don't be surprised.
* "Move before you are ready". You're making it a little more difficult for yourself, but your power
  and energy will rise to the demand; it must, because you've created that constraint.
* "Amor Fat" -- love of fate. Accept the fact that all events occur for a reason, and that it is
  within your capacity to see this reason as positive.

## Keep Moving -- Calculated Momentum (chap 4)

* 50 had a fluid position: understand the emerging trend of piracy and work with it, rather than
  being insular and clinging to past business models.
* "Let go of the need to control in such a direct manner... you no longer see change and chaotic
  moments in life as something to fear, but rather as a source of excitement and opportunity."
* The progress of time requires that at each turn, we produce different solutions, and also
  different approaches. From a passage of Sun Tzu.
* Success, or desperation, causes you to loosen up, become bolder, which then brings on more
  success, creating momentum. This is what Robert Greene is meaning by flow.
* Emotional flow: let emotions flow around and past you, so the negative ones don't have the power
  to distract you and hold you back.
  * For the duration that you're feeling a negative emotion, it will control you.
* Technique: "counterbalance": to combat distracting emotions, counterbalance them with the
  opposite. When you are fearful, force yourself to act more boldly than usual. When you feel hate,
  find some object of love or admiration to focus on with intensity.
  * Your team will come to see you as someone who has grace under pressure, a steady hand.
* Harnessing strong emotions for motivation is an illusion. It's short-lived; you want a slow, long
  burning fuel for your motivation.

## Know when to be bad: aggression (chap 5)

* Avoiding confrontations when there's another aggressor is an act of fear. Strength is to handle
  the conflict. It takes deliberate practice to build up this inner strength, so practice
  confronting aggressors and pushing for your interests.
* Being emotionally detached from the aggression of others:
  * "life naturally involves conflicting interests; people have their own agendas which collide with
    yours. Instead of taking this personally... you must simply work to protect and advance yourself
    in this competitive game. Focus your attention on their maneuvers and how to deflect them."

## Lead from the front -- authority (chap 6)

* The greatest generals in history are those who lead from the front. They can be seen by the troops
  at the head of the army, exposing themselves to the same fate as any foot soldier.
* "If you fail to unify the group around some glorious cause, some equivalent of the Promised Land,
  then you will find that you are having to push and pull your followers."
  * "You must assume a prophetic air, as if you were merely chosen to lead them towards some higher
    goal. You are compelling them to follow on their own, making less a show of personal power and
    more a demonstration of the cause."
  * You cannot control a large group on your own. You must develop a team of lieutenants who are
    infused with your ideas and values.
* It's hard for a group of people to keep a grand vision in mind. You must continually promote it.
  You must serve as the link to that vision.
* Louis XIV: he created a cause for the French people to believe in -- the greatness and glory of
  France itself, which had as its mission to be the center of civilization, a model for all of
  Europe. He led the country into wars to grow France's political might; he was a patron of the
  arts; he created impressive spectacles. The nobility were not fighting for Louis, but for the
  greatness of the nation.
* Do not be tempted to blend in, be one of the crew, and be likable. That's now how authority works.
  Authority sets you apart.

## Know your environment from the inside out: connection (chap 7)

* You must not start with the idea, but the public: their changing needs, the trends that are
  washing through them. Beginning with their demand, you create the appropriate supply.
* "Do not be afraid of people's criticisms -- without such feedback your work will be too personal
  and delusional."
* "Being on the inside" as a hustler: "the outside types never bother to learn anything about their
  customers. It's just about money and numbers. They have no concept of the nuances of people's
  psychology, their needs and demands. They're afraid to get close to the customer. The superior
  hustler moves to the inside. He's not afraid of the fiends; he wants to find out what's going on
  in their heads.
* Four methods for connecting with your audience and environment
  * "Crush all distance"
    * to reach people, you must have access to their inner lives. Their frustrations, aspirations,
      resentments. Take this upon yourself. Then when you create something that makes you happy, it
      will have the same effect on them. This requires a degree of fearlessness and an open spirit.
    * Reports/polls: "all of this information tends to be flat and highly filtered. It's much
      different when you interact directly with the publisher and hear in the flesh their criticisms
      and feedback. You discover what lies at the root of their discontent, the various nuances of
      how your work affects them. Their problems come to life, and any solutions you come up with
      will have more relevance."
    * "Get your feedback straight from the source."
  * "Reconnect with your base"
    * Young artists and innovators succeed because they have a deep connection with their social
      group and can make something relevant.
    * Then success creates distance, and they can't resonate with that group anymore.
  * "Create the social mirror"
    * "When your work does not communicate with others, consider it your own fault -- you did not
      make your ideas clear enough and you failed to connect with your audience emotionally. This
      will spare you any bitterness or anger that might come from people's critiques. You are simply
      perfecting your work through the social mirror."
    * (That's powerful).

## Respect the Process -- mastery (chap 8)

* We develop some discipline... but not nearly with the same urgency as someone who is starving.
  That person will eventually crush you. You need to be starving, hungering to close the gap.
* "All of a man's troubles come from not knowing how to sit still, alone in a room." -- Blaise
  Pascal
* "If you are really after power and mastery, then you will... engrave this idea in your mind: there
  are no shortcuts. You will distrust anything that is fast and easy. You will be able to endure the
  initial months of dull, repetitive labor, because you have an overall goal. This will prevent you
  from short-circuiting, knowing many things but mastering none of them. In the end, what you really
  will be doing is mastering yourself -- your impatience, your fear of boredom and empty time, your
  need for constant fun and amusement."
* Beware of books and arm chair learning. This doesn't allow trial and error, and embedding real
  world lessons in your nervous system. It's weak.
* For every thing you feel you don't have control over, you can get a taste for mastery by breaking
  off a little piece of that thing and getting better at it.
* "To feel inspired, you must first experience a moment of emptiness. Use such moments to assess the
  day that went by, to measure where you are headed. It is a relief to not feel that constant need
  for outside entertainment." PUT AWAY your phone when standing in line. Control yourself.

## Push beyond your limits -- self-belief (chap 9)

* Your sense of self-worth comes from you alone -- never the opinion of others.
* People follow those who know where they are going. So cultivate an air of certainty and boldness.
* He argues that everyone has a powerful and complex personality, but it gets shaped into convention
  by forces outside of yourself. Untie yourself from the opinions of others and be who you are. This
  is fearless.
* "The higher you raise your self-image, the fewer judgments and manipulations you will tolerate.
  This will translate into fewer obstacles in your path."

## The Hustler's Metamorphosis (chap 10)

* The power of a near death experience removed distractions and amped up his motivation.
  * "it filled him with a sense of urgency he had never experienced before, as if death were on his
    heels."
* He had simple principles to live by, which gave him power in selecting what he wanted to
  participate in
  * "certain things mattered to him more than anything else -- maintaining his long-term mobility,
    working with those who were excited and not mercenary, controlling his image and not muddying it
    for the sake of quick money. What this translated into was simple: he would exercise his power
    to walk away from any situation or person that compromised these values."
* "In his experience, whenever he felt as if he had too much to lose and he held on to others or to
  deals out of fear of the alternative, he ended up losing a lot more. He realized that the key in
  life is to *always* be willing to walk away."
* "From the moment we are born, we carry inside ourselves our death. It is not some outside event
  that ends our days but something within us. We have only so many days to live. This amount of time
  is something unique to us; it is ours alone, our only true possession.
* "When you choose to affirm life by confronting your mortality, everything changes. What matters to
  you now is to live your days well, as fully as possible."
* "You now have a way of measuring what matters in life -- compared to the shortness of your days,
  petty battles and anxieties have no weight. You have a sense of urgency and commitment -- what you
  do you must do well, with all of your energy, not with a mind shooting off in a hundred
  directions."
  * Me: so don't let your schedule hold you back. Or don't be lazy with someone you need to fire.
* "And when your time to die comes, as it will some day, you will not cringe and cry for more time,
  because you have lived well and have no regrets."
* Mortality: it's what ties all people together. When we look around at other people, we should see
  their mortality as well.

* "Greene maintains that Fifty personifies the renaissance of the pioneer spirit that made America
  great: he is self-reliant, fearless in response to adversity and unafraid of advances in
  technology." (Guardian review)
