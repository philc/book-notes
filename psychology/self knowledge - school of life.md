* Self ignorance (chap 1)
  * Most so-called "addictions" are at heart symptoms of insistent difficult feelings that we haven't found a
    way to address. Insomnia is revenge for thoughts we have refused to have in the day.
  * Socrates: "know thyself" -- this is the summary of all philosophy.
* Philosophical meditation (chap 2)
  * A set of exercises to explore our state of mind, and achieve calmness about what's in there.
  * This flavor is "western meditation."
  * It's "a practice with the premise that a decisive share of the trouble in our minds comes from thoughts
    and feelings that have not been untangled, examined and confronted with sufficient attention."
  * The output of philosophical meditation
    * "Fears, resentments, and hopes become easier to name. We become less scared of the contents of our own
      minds; we grow calmer, less resentful and clearer about our direction in life. We start, at least, to
      know ourselves a little better."
  * Key to the practice are three angled questions:
    * What am I presently anxious about?
    * What am I presently upset about?
    * What am I presently excited about?
  * Exercise: interpreting anxiety (looks productive)
    * Write down ~8 things you are anxious about. Each should be a single word.
    * 1) Practical unpacking: what steps do you need to take? What do others need to do? What's the sequence?
    * 2) Emotional unpacking: describe the emotional challenge and feeling in detail. Imagine trying to piece
      it together for a very considerate friend.
  * Exercise: upset
    * Enumerate offenses, big and small, around some scenario.
    * Now ask yourself: if this had happened to a friend, how would you advise them? What might you say?
  * Excitement
    * ""Often we don't pause to analyze the excitement any further and thereby miss out on opportunities for
      development."
    * What is this experience that I'm excited about telling me? Who is it inviting me to be?
  * Exercise: interpreting excitement
    * List the things that have recently caught your attention and interest. Moments of envy; daydreams, how
      nice someone or something was.
    * If you could realistically change your life in certain ways, what would it be to change in the light of
      this?
    * This exciting thing is a clue as to what's missing in your life. What might it be?
    * If this thing could try to change your life, what changes might it advise?
* Emotional identity (chap 3)
  * Self love
    * Warmth and confidence in ourselves.
    * With this, we are able to remain steadfast in the face of opposition and reversals.
    * "When another person frustrates or humiliates us, we may be able to let the insult go and even shrug it
      off, confident in our right to exist."
      * As opposed to needing to feel satisfied and made whole by the offensive person.
    * "When a love affair isn't working for us, do we have enough self-love to leave it quickly?"
  * Candor
    * How much can we admit to ourselves about who we are -- even if, or especially when, it's not very nice?
    * Can we admit mistakes? Can we admit to envy, sadness, and confusion?
    * "Valuable lessons usually come in painful guises." Can we receive candor from others?
  * Communication
    * Can we have a plausible second go: can we take seriously the thought that the other person isn't
      necessarily evil or stupid? Can we be calm enough to teach? To what degree can we admit that it is
      legitimate for others not to understand us, and additionally feel that there is a plausible, convincing
      journey we can take them on towards a proper appreciation of our point of view?
    * (Challenging...)
  * Trust
    * (I think by this they mean disposition towards the unknown: optimism, faith in others.
  * "Emotional transference": what our parents and families have taught us growing up.
* Honesty and denial (chap 4)
  * We lie to ourselves because we want to avoid pain.
  * We lie to ourselves about what we need to change in our lives. We invent rationalizations which allow us
    to maintain the status quo and avoid the need change.
  * We lie to ourselves about things that might disturb our self-image
  * "Manic cheeriness"
    * We develop a brittle, insistent tendency to say that all is very well. "This is lovely, isn't it?" we
      might press, leaving no room for any ideas to the contrary.
  * Drawbacks to lying to ourselves
    * We might key opportunities for growth and learning
      * The things we are in denial about are painful,l but they simultaneously contain material that is
        potentially vital to our overall growth and development.
    * We're not nice to be around: lying to yourself creates delusional views, defensiveness, and a condemning
      posture.
* Self judgement (chap 5)
  * Argues our self-esteem is determined by how harsh a critic our internal voice is. That voice is
    constructed by absorbing the tone of our care-givers, family, and close friends over our lifetime.
  * Afflicted by a lack of self-love, romantic relationships become almost impossible, for one of the central
    requirements of a capacity to accept the love of another turns out to be a confident degree of affection
    for ourselves.
  * Changing the inner voice
    * It's not that we should stop judging ourselves; rather that we should learn to be better judges of
      ourselves.
    * Judging ourselves is helpful for being grounded in reality and for self-improvement.
    * Strategies to change the tone of the inner voice
      * Identify a nice voice we knew int he past and give it more scope. Perhaps there was a kindly
        grandmother.
      * Try to become an imaginary friend to ourselves. In friendship, we know instinctively how to deploy
        strategies of wisdom and consolation. Good friends like you as you already are, and their suggestions
        are grounded in acceptance.
* Emotional skepticism (chap 6)
  * Emotional skepticism involves remaining highly cautious around our instincts, impulses, convictions and
    strong passions.
    * (Isn't this a recipe for weak conviction and being soft?)
  * Emotional skeptics distinguish between feeling and action
    * Ancient Greek Skeptics recommended that we learn to develop an attitude of what they called epoche,
      translated as "reserve" or "suspension of judgement". Aware of our proclivities to error, we should
      never rush into decisions; we should let our ideas settle so they can be re-evaluated at different
      points in time.
    * They are open to revising their beliefs over time.
