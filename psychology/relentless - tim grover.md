# Relentless - Tim Grover

## Intro

* "You already know what you have to do, and you know how to do it. What's stopping you?"
* "Being relentless means demanding more of yourself than anyone else could ever demand of you,
  knowing that every time you stop, you can still do more. You must do more."
* "From this point, your strategy is to make everyone else get on your level; you're not going down
  to theirs. You're not competing with anyone else, ever again."
* Situations: "we never saw obstacles or problems, we only saw situations in need of solutions."
  (training MJ)
* Become feared for your mental toughness, not just your skill.

## Cleaner

* Cleaner: someone who takes responsibility for everything. They clean up the situation, and the job
  gets done.
  * "I own this." Carry the weight, and get the people you need in place.
* "Calm and unflappable."
* "The idea of 'loving' what he does would mean he was content, and a Cleaner is never content."

## Pushing yourself harder when everyone else has had enough (chap 1)

* Mental conditioning: be eager rather than fearful of the next painful stage of development.
* Choose the tougher path.
* For athletes, mental conditioning should come first, and the physical training will follow.
* "My goal is to make it so challenging in the gym that everything that happens outside the gym
  seems easy. The work is about testing yourself and preparing all your options, so when you're
  performing, there's nothing to think about. Do the work before you need it, so you know what
  you're capable of when everyone else hits that panic button and looks at you."

## You get into the Zone, shut out everything else, and control the uncontrollable (chap 3)

* Concentration: intense and charged. "Others around you feel scared or jealous or excited... but
  you feel only readiness. No emotion, because in the Zone the only sensation is anger, a quiet, icy
  anger simmering under your skin... never rage, never out of control."
* "Anyone who has experienced the awesome power of the Zone will tell you it's deeply calm. It's not
  peaceful... but intensely focused. And once you're there, you have no fear, now worry, no emotion.
  You do what you came to do, and nothing can touch you."
* Everyone seems to have a different trigger that puts them in the zone. Like seeing the
  competition, or being criticized. (What is mine?)
* Avoid pregame hype and emotional highs, because they take you out of the zone. "Before a game, I
  don't want to see guys screaming each other into a frenzy... What happens right after that moment
  of insanity? It's over. Back to the sideline. Total letdown. Out of Zone."
* MJ is the only person he's ever seen who is always in the Zone. Before and during every game.
  * "If one thing separated Michael from every other player, it was his stunning ability to block
    out everything and everyone else."
* "A Cleaner thinks, if I'm feeling nervous, how the fuck are *they* feeling? They have to deal with
  *me*."

## You know exactly who you are (chap 3)

* Toddlers are born relentless
  * "What a waste. All that natural energy, drive, intuition, action... reduced to a time-out in the
    corner. From the time you're a toddler to the time you're an adult, you've been taught to be
    'good'. What's wrong with the way you were?"
* "Most people are like lions in cages". Natural instincts and ambition suppressed, waiting for
  something to happen.
* "How I want you to envision instinct: no thinking. Just the gut reaction that comes from being so
  ready, so prepared, so confident, that there's nothing to think about. If you're driving, and
  suddenly the car ahead of you slams on its brakes, do you pause to consider all your options or
  stop to ask for advice? No, you slam on the brakes."
* "In business, make more decisions with instincts."
* People who are good in practice but not in games: "they can't find the Zone, they're distracted by
  their own thought process, and they don't trust themselves. They're thinking about everything that
  can go wrong, thinking about what everyone else is doing, thinking instead of knowing, without a
  doubt, *I got this*."
* Instinct, not impulse: "Real learning doesn't mean clinging to the lessons. It means absorbing
  everything you can and then trusting yourself to use what you know instantaneously, without
  thinking. Instinctive, not impulsive... quick, not hurried. Knowing without a doubt that all the
  hours of work have created an unstoppable internal resource you can draw on in any situation.
  Having the maturity and experience to know who you are and how you go to the top, and the mental
  toughness to stay there."

## You have a dark side that refuses to be taught to be good (chap 4)

* "The dark side is your fuel... it excites you, keeps you on the edge, recharges you, fills your
  tank. It's your one escape, the only thing that takes your mind somewhere else and allows you to
  blow off steam for a brief time... it's anything that creates a private challenge and tests you to
  control it before it controls you."
* Athletes get only one chance per year to demonstrate that they are the best. "If you're so
  intensely wired to attack and win, you can't just turn that on and off, it's who you are, it
  defines you."
* "Really, is there that big a difference between the instincts of a powerful businessman, crime
  boss, and athlete? They're all "killers" in their field, driven to be the best, diabolical in
  their strategy. Attack, control, win."
* "Be honest: would you be as successful if you followed all the rules and always behaved and never
  took chances? No, you'd be just like everyone else, scared about failing and worried about being
  liked."

## You're not intimidated by pressure, you thrive on it (chap 5)

* If you're a true competitor, you always feel that pressure to attack and conquer, you thrive on
  it. You intentionally create situations to jack up the pressure even higher, challenging yourself
  to prove what you're capable of."
* "I tell my guys, 'Pressure, pressure, pressure.' Most people run from stress. I run to it. Stress
  keeps you sharp, it challenges you in ways you never imagined and forces you to solve issues and
  manage situations that send weaker people running for cover."
* Cleaners never feel external pressure; they only accept internal pressure.

## When everyone is hitting the "in case of emergency" button, they're all looking for you (chap 6)

* Do your thinking and planning in advance, so you can deploy reflexes at decision time, not
  original thought.
* You want to feel like you've prepped enough such that you know everything there is to know, so you
  can trust your ability to handle any situation.
* "Being relentless means having the courage to say, 'I'm going for this, and if I'm wrong, I'll
  make a change and I'll still be fine.'"

## You don't compete with anyone, you find your opponent's weakness and you attack (chap 7)

* MJ was never angry at his team mates if they underperformed -- he wouldn't be a victim. He would
  close the gap himself. "You're not playing tonight? That's fine, I'll play for all five of us. You
  keep it close into the fourth quarter, and I'll do the rest."
* MJ in relation to his Bulls teammates: "But don't be fooled: a true Cleaner isn't thinking about
  making you better for your benefit. He's happy for you if you get something out of it, but
  whatever he's doing, it's for his sake, not yours. His only objective is putting you where he
  needs you to be so he can get the result he desires."
* Portland rejected MJ as a draft pick because he couldn't serve as their center. "People who
  evaluate talent will always take the negative: 'He can't do this or that.' OK, what can he do? He
  got this far for a reason, how did he get here? Let's find out what he can do and put him in the
  system where he can succeed."
  * This thinking applies to recruiting.

## You make decisions, not suggestions. (chap 8)

* Be decisive.
* Take both ownership and responsibility: "once a Cleaner decides, it's set in stone; he doesn't
  care what anyone else thinks of his choice, and he's going to live with the outcome."
  * Relevant for my round 2.
* "You'll never hear me say, 'we have a problem.' We might have a situation that needs to be
  addressed... but never a problem. Why automatically cast something as a negative? Instincts don't
  recognize positive or negative. There's only a situation, your response, and an outcome. If you're
  ready for anything, you're not thinking about whether it's a good situation or a bad situation."
* Advises: don't sleep on situations or put them on the back burner. That's not being decisive.
* When you do deep analysis over a decision, don't you most often end up back at your first
  reaction? So stop delaying. Trust yourself.
  * "Meanwhile, as you sit back doing nothing because you're afraid to make a mistake, someone else
    is out there making all kinds of mistakes, learning from them, and getting to where you wanted
    to be. And probably laughing at your weakness."
* Be great at one thing: the very best at it. Be average or good at the other things. But know which
  thing should dominate your schedule.

## You don't have to love the work, but you're addicted to the results. (chap 9)

* It takes hard work all the time. Showing up every day, like a professional.
* When you reduce your competition to whining that you "got lucky," you know you're doing something
  right.
* "Anyone can start something. Few can finish."
* "When you're going through a world of pain, you never hide. You show up to work ready to go, you
  face adversity, and your critics and those who judge you, you step into the Zone and perform at
  that top level when everyone is expecting you to falter. That's being a professional.
  * MJ when his father died, and Wade during his divorce and custody battle.

## You'd rather be feared than liked (chap 10)

* "When you're completely focused on one thing -- your craft -- it's hard to pay attention to other
  people. You might sincerely care about how someone is doing, but you're not going to pick up the
  phone to find out, and if you do, it's usually because you have a motive for asking. You don't
  have time for chitchat or lunch or anything that distracts you from your single-minded focus. You
  don't care about being liked, you care about getting what you want. Not a great way to make and
  keep friends. But the only way to be truly relentless." This was Kobe and MJ.

## You trust very few people and those you trust better never let you down (chap 11)

* "Most of the time when we ask for advice, we don't want the truth. We want the answer we're
  seeking. Be open to advice that goes against what you want."
* Cleaners trust few people; they'd almost always rather follow their instincts and fix the
  situation later if they're wrong, than trust someone else and kick themselves for not listening to
  that voice inside. If a Cleaner screws up, he wants it to be because he did what he thought was
  right, not because he did what someone else told him to do."

## You don't recognize failure; you know there's more than one way to get what you want (chap 12)

* MJ's return: "as usual, they were wrong. A Cleaner is done when he says he's done, not when you
  say he's done."
* Reframing reality: "Success and failure are 100 percent mental. One person's idea of success might
  seem like a complete failure to someone else. You must establish your own vision of what it means
  to be unstoppable; you can't let anyone else define that for you."
* "When someone else says you've failed, what they really mean is 'if that were me, I would feel
  like a failure.' Well, that guy's not you, and he's obviously not a Cleaner, because Cleaners
  don't recognize failure."
* "A Cleaner never sees failure because to him, it's never over. If something doesn't go as planned,
  he instinctively looks for options to make things work a different way. He doesn't feel
  embarrassed or ashamed, he doesn't blame anyone else, and he doesn't care what anyone else says
  about his situation. It's never the end, it's never over. And he knows, without a doubt, that
  whatever happens, he'll find a way to come out on top. If you ever find me and a bear wrestling in
  the woods, help the bear."
* Don't try; act. And keep acting, with different tactics and from different directions, until
  you've mastered the situation.
* Being able to sensibly change directions is a great strength for the tenacious. Being inflexible
  is weak.

## You don't celebrate your achievements because you always want more (chap 13)

* After a win, get back to work: "there's always more work to do. And more to prove. Always more to
  prove."
* What's driving us? that electrifying, powerful surge of satisfaction when we complete the job.
