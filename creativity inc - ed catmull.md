* Gems
  * "Not only did I often sleep on the floor of the computer rooms to maximize time on the computer,
    but so did many of my fellow graduate students. We were young, driven by the sense that we were
    inventing the field from scratch -- and that was exciting beyond words."
  * Toy Story 2 retrospective: "Get the team right!"
    * "If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. If you give a mediocre
      idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something
      better."
  * A good team is not about individual talents. It's about how they work together: the chemistry.
  * By the nature of the deep creative work, the director fuses with the project and loses
    perspective. Passion blinds them. The Braintrust helps with this.
  * "If you aren't experiencing failure, then you are making a far worse mistake: you are being
    driven by the desire to avoid it."
    * The absence of mistakes is an indicator of poor progress.
* Intro
  * "What they miss is that the unifying idea for [Pixar's campus] isn't luxury but community. Steve
    wanted the building to support our work by enhancing our ability to collaborate."
  * "Self-expression, palpable energy; air of possibility."
  * What makes Pixar special: "We will always have problems, many of them hidden from our view; that
    we work hard to uncover these problem,s even if doing so means making ourselves uncomfortable;
    and that, when we come across a problem,, we marhsall all of our energies to solve it."
  * His lifelong dream was to animate a feature film. It took Ed 20 years to do that. Once Toy Story
    shipped, his internal compass of purpose was adrift.
  * "As I turned my attention from solving technical problems to engaging with the philosophy of
    sound management, I was excited once again -- and sure that our second act could be as
    exhilarating as our first."
    * (He seems introspective. He didn't want his company to fall apart like other public or
      well-funded tech companies he'd seen who did so, despite having brilliant founders.)
  * "We accept that, without meaning to, our company is stifling that talent in myriad unseen ways."
    So we ask ourselves "How to enable smart ambitious people to work together?"
    * Discovering the blocks to creative work became a fascinating problem for him.
* Animated (chap 1)
  * His graduate prof was Ivan Sutherland, author of Sketchpad. University of Utah was one of the
    four nodes in ARPANET. Ed had a front row seat to many emerging technologies.
  * "Not only did I often sleep on the floor of the computer rooms to maximize time on the computer,
    but so did many of my fellow graduate students. We were young, driven by the sense that we were
    inventing the field from scratch -- and that was exciting beyond words."
* Pixar is born (chap 2)
  * Ed builds a graphics group in New York, moves everyone to Lucasfilm, and then is sold to Steve
    Jobs.
  * "Always take a chance on better, even if it seems threatening."
    * Hiring people smarter, more ambitious than you, to make your team perform well.
  * His first job was to assemble an elite graphics team for an eccentric millionaire.
  * The movie studios weren't interested at all in computers to help with film making. That would
    change once Star Wars debuted.
  * "In the intervening years, George has said that he hired me because of my honest, my 'clarity of
    vision,' and my steadfast belief in what computers could do."
  * A great way to tell the story of a company. Like ISrael seeking the land of Canon:
    * "Building a company was like being on a wagon train headed west. On the long journey to the
      land of plenty, the pioneers would be full of purpose and united by the goal of reaching their
      destination. Once they arrived, he'd say, people would come and go, and that was as it should
      be. But the process of moving *toward* something -- of having not yet arrived -- was what he
      idealized."
  * "John was a born dreamer. As a boy, he lived mostly in his head and in the tree houses and
    tunnels and spaceships he drew in his sketchbook."
  * "This was my first encounter with a phenomenon I would notice again and again, throughout my
    career: for all the care you put into artistry, visual polish frequently doesn't matter if you
    are getting the story right."
  * Lucas splits with his wife and now needs to sell Pixar to regain cash. No buyers are interested,
    because commercial applications will take another $15M to develop.
  * Steve originally desired that Pixar serve as the foundation of NeXT.
  * Steve bought 70% of the stock for $10M. 30% went to the employees.
* A defining goal (chap 3)
  * Post Toy Story 1, the goal became: build a creative culture that would endure past the founders
    and provide enduring malleability and excellence.
  * "One thing we had to figure out in the early days of Pixar was the yin and yang of working with
    Steve. His determination to succeed and his willingness to think big were often inspiring."
  * The advice Ed was getting -- sometimes simple answers to complex questions -- was misleading and
    unhelpful, and he lacked the confidence to see this.
    * Simple answers like the 'start high' pricing advice -- so seductive in its rationality -- had
      distracted me and kept me from asking more fundamental questions.
  * (Deming's Japanese lean manufacturing techniques had a profound impact on Ed. "Everyone should
    be wmpoered to take responsibility for the quality of the product."
  * Pixar could not make hardware sales work, and so they pivoted one last tiem to entirely
    animation.
  * 1991: laid off 1/3 of employees.
  * Steve tried to sell them three times. The offers weren't bad -- $40M from Microsoft. Steve was
    using these for external validation.
  * Huge breakthrough: 1991 cut a deal with Disney to make 3 feature length films. Disney wanted
    more output after their success with Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and Lion
    King.
  * "In 1991, two of the year's biggest blockbusters -- Beauty and the Beast and Terminator 2 -- had
    relied heavily on technology that had been developed at Pixar, and people in Hollywood were
    starting to pay attention."
  * "John once described Steve's story as the classic Hero's Journey. Banished for his hubris from
    the company he founded, he wandered through the wilderness having a series of adventures that,
    in the end, changed him for the better. I have much to say about Steve's transformation and the
    role Pixar played in it, but for now, I will simply assert that failure made him better, wiser,
    and kinder."
  * As they felt good about Toy Story's imminent release, Steve scrambled to IPO them so they could
    renegotiate their contract with Disney. Great foresight and hustle! (They IPO'd in 1995)
  * How to understand a problem once spotted? Attention, and lots of conversations.
    * (It's not hard, but I feel like I try to jump straight to a solution, because I'm impatient or
      short on bandwidth)
  * Finding a culture problem and trying to solve it was invigorating for everyone.
  * Trying to sense future ways the company could be harmed or undone:
    * "What would happen to our egos if we continued to succeed? Would they grow so large they could
      hurt us, and if so, what could we do to address that overconfidence?"
* Establishing Pixar's identity (chap 4)
  * Two mantras developed:
    * Story is King. Made priorities clear, pu tech and merchandising in its place.
    * Trust the Process
      * Focus on building the process.
      * Pride in the Pixar way
  * The initial junior team working on Toy Story 2 failed. Lasseter stepped in and took over. Ed
    asked himself: how did that happen?
  * "As Lee Unkrich says, 'We had done the impossible. We had done the thing that everyone told us
    we couldn't do. And we had done it spectacularly well. It was the fuel that has continued to
    burn in all of us.'"
    * Building a high quality sequel on a frantic 9 months, under pressure to make it
      direct-to-video...
  * Toy Story 2 retrospective: "Get the team right!"
    * "If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. If you give a mediocre
      idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something
      better."
  * A good team is not about individual talents. It's about how they work together: the chemistry.
  * Good people are more important than "good ideas." Ideas don't go anywhere without good people who
    develop them and bring them to life with a thousand supporting ideas.
* Honesty and candor (chap 5)
  * Every leader of a deep creative project gets so immersed that they lose touch. Expect this.
    Provide strong feedback mechanisms, like Pixar's 3-month Braintrust reviews.
  * Candor is a better term/goal than honesty.
    * Candor has less moral baggage than honesty, so it's easier to ask for, and easier to give.
  * Brain trust system for straight-talk. Root out mediocrity.
    * Another term for this is "solutions group."
  * The members saw each other as peers. There was not energy spent on getting credit for an idea,
    winning points, pleasing supervisors.
  * By the nature of the deep creative work, the director fuses with the project and loses
    perspective. Passion blinds them. The Braintrust helps with this.
  * "By removing from the Braintrust the power to mandate solutions, we affect the dynamics of the
    group in ways I believe are essential."
    * More like "peer review." The solutions will be tough, and so the director has to be the one to
      search for them.
  * "It's as if they've gathered a panel of consulting experts to help find an accurate diangosis
    for an extremely confounding case. But ultimately, it's the filmmakers, and no one else, who will
    make the final decisions about the wisest course of treatment."
* Fear and failure (chap 6)
  * Management's job is not to prevent risk, but build the ability to recover."
  * Repeated failure is necessary for creative work. Careful master plans don't work.
  * Fear of failure is very hard to remove. Fear must be identified, diagnosed, and removed with
    explicit mechanisms of trust.
  * "If you aren't experiencing failure, then you are making a far worse mistake: you are being
    driven by the desire to avoid it."
    * The absence of mistakes is an indicator of poor progress.
  * Failure is on occasional consequence of decisiveness.
  * Creative endeavors are like science: trying something and failing yields faster information and
    thus better success than careful design and planning. And you get less attached to an approach.
  * Product research versus development and scaling phase:
    * "We've set up a sy stem in which directors are allowed to spend years in the development phase
      of a movie, where the costs off iteration and exploration are relatively low. (At this point,
      we're paying the director's and story artists' salaries but not putting anything into
      production, which is where costs explode.)
