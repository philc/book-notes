* Gems
  * "Not only did I often sleep on the floor of the computer rooms to maximize time on the computer,
    but so did many of my fellow graduate students. We were young, driven by the sense that we were
    inventing the field from scratch -- and that was exciting beyond words."
  * Toy Story 2 retrospective: "Get the team right!"
    * "If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. If you give a mediocre
      idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something
      better."
  * A good team is not about individual talents. It's about how they work together: the chemistry.
  * By the nature of the deep creative work, the director fuses with the project and loses
    perspective. Passion blinds them. The Braintrust helps with this.
  * "If you aren't experiencing failure, then you are making a far worse mistake: you are being
    driven by the desire to avoid it."
    * The absence of mistakes is an indicator of poor progress.
    * Failure is an occasional consequence of decisiveness.
  * "Only from struggle does clarity emerge."
  * In postmortems, "I like data because it is neutral -- there are no value judgments, only facts.
    That allows people to discuss the issues raised by data less emotionally than they might an

  * Notes day: An epic, all day session where everyone in the company discusses their ideas for how
    to make the company better, with a focused theme (e.g. "3 movies in 2 years") for the breakout
    sessions. Cathartic. Encourages candor, ownership, and a long-term view of and participation in
    the company.
* Intro
  * "What they miss is that the unifying idea for [Pixar's campus] isn't luxury but community. Steve
    wanted the building to support our work by enhancing our ability to collaborate."
  * "Self-expression, palpable energy; air of possibility."
  * What makes Pixar special: "We will always have problems, many of them hidden from our view; that
    we work hard to uncover these problems, even if doing so means making ourselves uncomfortable;
    and that, when we come across a problem, we marshall all of our energies to solve it."
  * His lifelong dream was to animate a feature film. It took Ed 20 years to do that. Once Toy Story
    shipped, his internal compass of purpose was adrift.
  * "As I turned my attention from solving technical problems to engaging with the philosophy of
    sound management, I was excited once again -- and sure that our second act could be as
    exhilarating as our first."
    * (He seems introspective. He didn't want his company to fall apart like other public or
      well-funded tech companies he'd seen who did so, despite having brilliant founders.)
  * "We accept that, without meaning to, our company is stifling that talent in myriad unseen ways."
    So we ask ourselves "How to enable smart ambitious people to work together?"
    * Discovering the blocks to creative work became a fascinating problem for him.
* Animated (chap 1)
  * His graduate prof was Ivan Sutherland, author of Sketchpad. University of Utah was one of the
    four nodes in ARPANET. Ed had a front row seat to many emerging technologies.
  * "Not only did I often sleep on the floor of the computer rooms to maximize time on the computer,
    but so did many of my fellow graduate students. We were young, driven by the sense that we were
    inventing the field from scratch -- and that was exciting beyond words."
* Pixar is born (chap 2)
  * Ed builds a graphics group in New York, moves everyone to Lucasfilm, and then is sold to Steve
    Jobs.
  * "Always take a chance on better, even if it seems threatening."
    * Hiring people smarter, more ambitious than you, to make your team perform well.
  * His first job was to assemble an elite graphics team for an eccentric millionaire.
  * The movie studios weren't interested at all in computers to help with film making. That would
    change once Star Wars debuted.
  * "In the intervening years, George has said that he hired me because of my honesty, my 'clarity
    of vision,' and my steadfast belief in what computers could do."
  * A great way to tell the story of a company. Like Israel seeking the land of Canon:
    * "Building a company was like being on a wagon train headed west. On the long journey to the
      land of plenty, the pioneers would be full of purpose and united by the goal of reaching their
      destination. Once they arrived, he'd say, people would come and go, and that was as it should
      be. But the process of moving *toward* something -- of having not yet arrived -- was what he
      idealized."
  * "John was a born dreamer. As a boy, he lived mostly in his head and in the tree houses and
    tunnels and spaceships he drew in his sketchbook."
  * "This was my first encounter with a phenomenon I would notice again and again, throughout my
    career: for all the care you put into artistry, visual polish frequently doesn't matter if you
    are getting the story right."
  * Lucas splits with his wife and now needs to sell Pixar to regain cash. No buyers are interested,
    because commercial applications will take another $15M to develop.
  * Steve originally desired that Pixar serve as the foundation of NeXT.
  * Steve bought 70% of the stock for $10M. 30% went to the employees.
* A defining goal (chap 3)
  * Post Toy Story 1, the goal became: build a creative culture that would endure past the founders
    and provide enduring malleability and excellence.
  * "One thing we had to figure out in the early days of Pixar was the yin and yang of working with
    Steve. His determination to succeed and his willingness to think big were often inspiring."
  * The advice Ed was getting -- sometimes simple answers to complex questions -- was misleading and
    unhelpful, and he lacked the confidence to see this.
    * Simple answers like the 'start high' pricing advice -- so seductive in its rationality -- had
      distracted me and kept me from asking more fundamental questions.
  * (Deming's Japanese lean manufacturing techniques had a profound impact on Ed. "Everyone should
    be empowered to take responsibility for the quality of the product."
  * Pixar could not make hardware sales work, and so they pivoted one last time to entirely
    animation.
  * 1991: laid off 1/3 of employees.
  * Steve tried to sell them three times. The offers weren't bad -- $40M from Microsoft. Steve was
    using these for external validation.
  * Huge breakthrough: 1991 cut a deal with Disney to make 3 feature length films. Disney wanted
    more output after their success with Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and Lion
    King.
  * "In 1991, two of the year's biggest blockbusters -- Beauty and the Beast and Terminator 2 -- had
    relied heavily on technology that had been developed at Pixar, and people in Hollywood were
    starting to pay attention."
  * "John once described Steve's story as the classic Hero's Journey. Banished for his hubris from
    the company he founded, he wandered through the wilderness having a series of adventures that,
    in the end, changed him for the better. I have much to say about Steve's transformation and the
    role Pixar played in it, but for now, I will simply assert that failure made him better, wiser,
    and kinder."
  * As they felt good about Toy Story's imminent release, Steve scrambled to IPO them so they could
    renegotiate their contract with Disney. (Great foresight and hustle! They went public in 1995).
  * How to understand a problem once spotted? Attention, and lots of conversations.
    * (It's not hard, but I feel like I try to jump straight to a solution, because I'm impatient or
      feel short on bandwidth)
  * Finding a culture problem and trying to solve it was invigorating for everyone.
  * Trying to sense future ways the company could be harmed or undone:
    * "What would happen to our egos if we continued to succeed? Would they grow so large they could
      hurt us, and if so, what could we do to address that overconfidence?"
* Establishing Pixar's identity (chap 4)
  * Two mantras developed:
    * Story is King. It made priorities clear, and it put tech and merchandising in their place.
    * Trust the Process
      * Focus on building the process
      * Pride in the Pixar way
  * The initial junior team working on Toy Story 2 failed. Lasseter stepped in and took over. Ed
    asked himself: how did that happen?
  * "As Lee Unkrich says, 'We had done the impossible. We had done the thing that everyone told us
    we couldn't do. And we had done it spectacularly well. It was the fuel that has continued to
    burn in all of us.'"
    * Building a high quality sequel on a frantic 9 months, under pressure to make it
      direct-to-video...
  * Toy Story 2 retrospective: "Get the team right!"
    * "If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. If you give a mediocre
      idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something
      better."
  * A good team is not about individual talents. It's about how they work together: the chemistry.
  * Good people are more important than "good ideas." Ideas don't go anywhere without good people
    who develop them and bring them to life with a thousand supporting ideas.
* Honesty and candor (chap 5)
  * Every leader of a deep creative project gets so immersed that they lose touch. Expect this.
    Provide strong feedback mechanisms, like Pixar's 3-month Braintrust reviews.
  * Candor is a better term/goal than honesty.
    * Candor has less moral baggage than honesty, so it's easier to ask for, and easier to give.
  * Brain trust system for straight-talk. Root out mediocrity.
    * Another term for this is "solutions group."
  * The members saw each other as peers. There was not energy spent on getting credit for an idea,
    winning points, pleasing supervisors.
  * By the nature of the deep creative work, the director fuses with the project and loses
    perspective. Passion blinds them. The Braintrust helps with this.
  * "By removing from the Braintrust the power to mandate solutions, we affect the dynamics of the
    group in ways I believe are essential."
    * More like "peer review." The solutions will be tough, and so the director has to be the one to
      search for them.
  * "It's as if they've gathered a panel of consulting experts to help find an accurate diagnosis
    for an extremely confounding case. But ultimately, it's the filmmakers, and no one else, who
    will make the final decisions about the wisest course of treatment."
* Fear and failure (chap 6)
  * "Management's job is not to prevent risk, but build the ability to recover."
  * Repeated failure is necessary for creative work. Careful master plans don't work.
  * Fear of failure is very hard to remove. Fear must be identified, diagnosed, and removed with
    explicit mechanisms of trust.
  * "If you aren't experiencing failure, then you are making a far worse mistake: you are being
    driven by the desire to avoid it."
    * The absence of mistakes is an indicator of poor progress.
  * Failure is an occasional consequence of decisiveness.
  * Creative endeavors are like science: trying something and failing yields faster information and
    thus more success than careful design and planning. And you get less attached to an approach.
  * Product research versus development and scaling phase:
    * "We've set up a system in which directors are allowed to spend years in the development phase
      of a movie, where the costs off iteration and exploration are relatively low. (At this point,
      we're paying the director's and story artists' salaries but not putting anything into
      production, which is where costs explode.)
* The hungry beast and the ugly baby (chap 7)
  * A metaphor for meeting production and revenue goals vs. incubating new ideas.
    * The hungry beast: shipping, market expansion, revenue production
    * Ugly baby: nascent ideas which are immature, vulnerable, hard to prioritize
  * New ideas are unproven and have no friends. They need protection or you'll never get any of them
    off the ground, and you will plateau.
  * Both new ideas, and hitting existing production goals, are valuable endeavors. You want an
    explicit balance.
  * "Part of our job is to protect the new from people who don't understand that in order for
    greatness to emerge, there must be phases of not-so-greatness."
    * "Protect the new" to make sure unusual immature ideas have their chance to mature and prove
      themselves.
  * "In a healthy culture, all constituencies recognize the importance of balancing competing
    desires -- they want to be heard, but they don't have to win. Their interaction with one another
    -- the push and pull that occurs naturally when talented people are given clear goals -- yields
    the balance we seek. But that only happens if they understand that achieving balance is a
    central goal of the company."
    * (Interesting. Marketing vs. sales; product vs. eng.)
  * Balancing group size: larger teams means more/ better work, but less intimate meetings and
    smaller ownership. Refactoring into smaller teams can help with that.
  * "I often say that managers of creative enterprises must hold lightly to goals and firmly to
    intentions."
    * Intentions or values survive much better and are more helpful compasses than goals.
  * "Negative feedback may be fun, but it is far less brave than endorsing something unproven and
    providing room for it to grow."
  * Creativity in isolation doesn't work
    * "I know some people who like to keep their gem completely to themselves while they polish it.
      But allowing this kind of behavior isn't productive. In fact, it can be the opposite: a
      failure to protect your employees from themselves. Because if history is any guide, some are
      diligently trying to polish a brick."
  * The Beast is a productive force, eliciting progress and engagement with the real world.
* Change and randomness (chap 8)
  * No plan survives. Your org is designed to handle the change and produce a better strategy.
  * Change is hard. Success comes from doing the hard work.
  * "One trick I've learned is to force myself to make a list of what's actually wrong. Usually,
    soon into making the list, I find I can group most of the issues into two or three larger
    all-encompassing problems. So it's really not all that bad. Having a finite list of problems is
    much better than having an illogical feeling that *everything* is wrong."
  * "I believe life should not be easy. We're meant to push ourselves and try new things -- which
    will definitely make us feel uncomfortable. Living through a few big catastrophes helps. After
    people survived A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2, they realized the pressure led to some pretty cool
    ideas."
    * He's skeptical of film pitches which have the pieces hanging together from the outset.
    * Similar to an angel investment pitch. It's all going to change. You have to be able to do the
      hard iterations.
    * "Only from struggle does clarity emerge."
  * Looking backward to a good leader or a golden era will not take you forward to greatness.
    * "He never wanted people to ask, 'What would Steve do?' No one -- not Walt, not Steve, not the
      people of Pixar -- ever achieved creative success by simply clinging to what used to work."
* The Hidden (chap 9)
  * "It behooves us to ask ourselves constantly: how much are we able to see? And how much is
    obscured from view?"
  * Every good company will make poor decisions and fail in some way. They will suffer from a
    problem they can't see. The goal is to see as many of those as possible; see the hidden.
* Broadening our view (chap 10)
  * (Outline of Pixar's techniques for avoiding rigidity in their viewpoints: dailies, postmortems,
    research trips, adhering to various constraints.)
  * "As more people are added to any group, there is an inexorable drift toward inflexibility."
  * Dailies: the daily critique of the animation frames that the team is working on.
  * Research trips: to understand the details of the problem, find the unexpected, and become
    authentic, not derivative.
  * Constraints
    * Budgets and prioritization to avoid pouring time into details which don't advance the project
      much.
      * But don't do this too early, in the discovery phase, because that can limit creativity and
        exploration.
  * Postmortems
    * Held right after shipping every major movie.
    * Organize the lessons learned, for the rest of the company and for producing better films.
    * Also gives team members a release valve to productively vent frustrations.
    * Data they collect to fuel their postmortems:
      * "We keep track of the rates at which things happen, how often something has to be reworked,
        how long something actually took versus how long we estimated it would take, whether a piece
        of work was completely finished or not when it was sent to another department, and so on."
      * "I like data because it is neutral -- there are no value judgments, only facts. That allows
        people to discuss the issues raised by data less emotionally than they might an anecdotal
        experience."
  * Pixar University is mainly about the cultural signal that people should always be learning and
    exploring.
* The unmade future (chap 11)
  * A tour of the mental models or "coping mechanisms" used by people at Pixar to drive into the
    creative unknown and endure the uncertainty.
    * Mental models for thinking about how to get people to an unknown destination.
  * Creativity through "protracted struggle."
  * Directing is like skiing. You go fast, you don't have full control, and you have limited time to
    decide. You stay up if you plow forward and don't over-think it. You must be relaxed, zen-like.
  * Pretending you have as much time as you need, even when you don't, so you don't thrash, and you
    actually progress on problems.
  * Action bias, "zipping through" complex problems.
    * (But if the problem is hard, will you ever get the answer this way?)
    * "For [Andrew Stanton], moving quickly is a plus because it prevents him from getting stuck
      worrying about whether his chosen course of action is the wrong one. Instead, he favors being
      decisive, then forgiving yourself if your initial decision proves misguided."
  * The creative process is a long dark tunnel. In the middle is dark and uncertain, but assuming
    there's a solution, you will emerge from the darkness if you press forward. Your compass will
    allow you to endure the uncertainty.
    * "Our fear stems from the need to make the nonexistent come into being. As we've discussed,
      people often try to overcome this fear by simply repeating what has worked in the past. That
      leads nowhere -- or, or more accurately, it leads in the opposite direction of originality.
      The trick is to use our skills and knowledge not to duplicate but to invent."
  * "I've now described several models, and the thing I believe the have in common is the search for
    an unseen destination -- for land across the ocean (Andrew), for light at the end of the tunnel
    (Pete), for a way out of the maze (Rich), for the mountain itself (Michael)."
* A new challenge (chap 12)
  * Pre-acquisition, to assuage employee fears they drafted a 7-page list of comp and cultural items
    that wouldn't change for five years.
    * "We were different, and since we believe being different helps us maintain our identity, we
      wanted to remain that way."
  * They wanted to keep both studios (Pixar, Disney Animation) entirely separate.
    * (He didn't elaborate on why)
  * The feedback system at Disney had mandatory changes which came from non-filmmakers. They
    abolished mandatory changes, which restored ownership to the directors.
  * Ed and John spent a lot of time fixing Disney Animation, and used it as an opportunity to
    empower other leaders to steer Pixar.
    * They pushed "research trips" onto the folks at Disney ANimation, so that everything they threw
      on screen -- sets, characters -- would be genuine.
  * About Tangled: "The movie went on to earn more than $590 million worldwide, becoming the
    second-highest-grossing film from Disney Animation ever, after The Lion King. The studio had its
    first number one hit in sixteen years, and the reverberations with the building were palpable."
* Notes day (chap 13)
  * An epic, all day session where everyone in the company discusses their ideas for how to make the
    company better, with a focused theme (e.g. "3 movies in 2 years") for the breakout sessions.
  * Cathartic. Encourages candor, ownership, and a long-term view of and participation in the
    company.
