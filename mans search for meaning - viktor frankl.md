* Experiences in a concentration camp (chap 1)
  * "We who have come back, by the aid of many lucky chances or miracles -- whatever one may choose to call
    them -- we know: the best of us did not return."
    * Because it takes sacrificing others -- your friends -- to survive. The transports always took a set
      number of prisoners to the gas chambers. For you to escape, someone else must go in your place.
  * "When we saw a comrade smoking his own cigarettes, we knew he had given up faith in his strength to carry
    on, and, once lost, the will to live seldom returned."
    * The only prisoners who smoked cigarettes they'd been awarded were those who'd given up the will to live
      and wanted to enjoy their last few days. Otherwise, they could be traded for food.
  * Prisoners upon arriving were sorted into two groups, "right or left", based on whether you looked like you
    could work. 90% were assigned to the gas chambers and killed within hours. "The first such fateful
    selection process."
  * "The sufferers, the dying and the dead, became such commonplace sights to him after a few weeks of camp
    life that they could not move him any more."
    * Apathy, numbness, such that disgust and aversion receded among the camp dwellers.
  * "Reality dimmed, and all efforts and all emotions were centered on one task: preserving one's own life and
    that of the other fellow."
    * "It was typical to hear the prisoners, while they were being herded back to camp from their work sites
      in the evening, sigh with relief and say, 'Well, another day is over.'"
    * Apathy was important self-defense.
  * Prisoners would fantasize about food, tell of their favorite recipes, discuss the menus of the reunion
    banquets they would have together after this was over. Because they were starving, they couldn't focus on
    anything else.
  * They were dramatically underfed. Fat would disappear, then muscle, then they would die. Straightforward to
    predict who would die next. (Why would they starve this labor pool so much?)
  * Fixating on the image of his wife, imagining the conversations she would have with him now, as an inner
    retreat during the hard labor.
    * "This intensification of inner life helped the prisoner find a refuge from the emptiness, desolation and
      spiritual poverty of his existence, by letting him escape into the past.
  * Identity broke down, ego suffered a loss of values. The The circumstances were so meaningless; being used
    until physical resources were depleted, then efficiently killed, in service of men you hate.
  * Reaction to "enforced community life."
    * "The prisoner craved to be alone with himself and his thoughts. He yearned for privacy and for
      solitude."
  * When deciding on escape attempts, it was torment to have to make decisions about one's own fate. Each
    prisoner desired escape from commitment. Due to apathy and hopelessness. "Let fate run its course."
    * "I ran out of the hut and told my friend that I could not go with him. As soon as I had told him with
      finality that I had made up my mind to stay with my patients, the unhappy feeling left me. I did not
      know what the following days would bring, but I had gained an inward peace that I had never experienced
      before. I returned to the hut, sat down on the boards at my countryman's feet and tried to comfort him;
      then I chatted with the others, trying to quiet them in their delirium."
  * Damn, so close to an arbitrary death, as he was finally being released:
    * "Many weeks later we found out that even in those last hours fate had toyed with us few remaining
      prisoners. We found out just how uncertain human decisions are, especially in matters of life and death.
      I was confronted with photographs which had been taken in a small camp not far from ours. Our friends
      who had thought they were traveling to freedom that night had been taken in the trucks to this camp, and
      they were locked in the huts and burned to death. Their partially charred bodies were recognizable on
      the photograph."
  * Choosing how you respond to suffering is a meaningful freedom
    * Those generous prisoners who gave away their last piece of bread and comforted others in the infirmary
      tents: "thought few in number, they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but
      one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances,
      to choose one's own way."
    * "And there was always choices to make. Every day, every hour, offered the opportunity to make a
      decision, a decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which
      threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom; which determined whether or not you would
      become the plaything of circumstance,s renouncing freedom and dignity to become molded into the form of
      the typical inmate."
    * "Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the
      moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his
      sufferings or not."
    * A life that can only demonstrate a noble attitude in the face of suffering can still be meaningful, in
      the same way that a creative life is full of meaning. It can still demonstrate dignity, unselfishness.
  * Being robbed of one's future
    * "On entering camp a chance took place in the minds of the men. With the end of uncertainty there came the
      uncertainty of the end. It was impossible to foresee whether or when, if at all, this form of existence
      would end."
    * Prisoners, in a new uncertain state of life, could no longer live for the future, because of their wildly
      uncertain present. Similar effect happens to the unemployed. Without a future and without a goal. A
      feeling of lifelessness, as if they'd already died. Everything became pointless. But this frame of mind
      robbed the prisoners of the ability to see small opportunities to grow spiritually.
      * "People forgot that often it is just such an exceptionally difficult external situation which gives man
        the opportunity to grow spiritually beyond himself."
    * "It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future."
      * Even in prison, some found a goal and strove for it.
  * The impact of hope on one's immune system
    * "The sudden loss of hope and courage can have a deadly effect."
    * Many died at Christmas. The explanation is that their disappointment at not being home by Christmas
      overcame their hope, and thus their strength to live.
  * "We had to reach the despairing men, that it did not matter what we expected from life, but rather what
    life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of
    ourselves as those who were being questioned by life -- daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in
    talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct."
  * Their task in life: to reveal their character and greatness
    * "Once the meaning of suffering had been revealed to us, we refused to minimize or alleviate the camp's
      tortures by ignoring them or harboring false illusions and entertaining artificial optimism. Suffering
      had become a task on which we did not want to turn our backs."
    * With this framing, there were "hidden opportunities for achievement" in their situation. "There's plenty
      of suffering to work through."
  * "A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits
    for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the 'why' for his
    existence, and will be able to bear almost any 'how'."
