* Experiences in a concentration camp (part 1)
  * "We who have come back, by the aid of many lucky chances or miracles -- whatever one may choose to call
    them -- we know: the best of us did not return."
    * Because it takes sacrificing others -- your friends -- to survive. The transports always took a set
      number of prisoners to the gas chambers. For you to escape, someone else must go in your place.
  * "When we saw a comrade smoking his own cigarettes, we knew he had given up faith in his strength to carry
    on, and, once lost, the will to live seldom returned."
    * The only prisoners who smoked cigarettes they'd been awarded were those who'd given up the will to live
      and wanted to enjoy their last few days. Otherwise, they could be traded for food.
  * Prisoners upon arriving were sorted into two groups, "right or left", based on whether you looked like you
    could work. 90% were assigned to the gas chambers and killed within hours. "The first such fateful
    selection process."
  * "The sufferers, the dying and the dead, became such commonplace sights to him after a few weeks of camp
    life that they could not move him any more."
    * Apathy, numbness, such that disgust and aversion receded among the camp dwellers.
  * "Reality dimmed, and all efforts and all emotions were centered on one task: preserving one's own life and
    that of the other fellow."
    * "It was typical to hear the prisoners, while they were being herded back to camp from their work sites
      in the evening, sigh with relief and say, 'Well, another day is over.'"
    * Apathy was important self-defense.
  * Prisoners would fantasize about food, tell of their favorite recipes, discuss the menus of the reunion
    banquets they would have together after this was over. Because they were starving, they couldn't focus on
    anything else.
  * They were dramatically underfed. Fat would disappear, then muscle, then they would die. Straightforward to
    predict who would die next. (Why would they starve this labor pool so much?)
  * Fixating on the image of his wife, imagining the conversations she would have with him now, as an inner
    retreat during the hard labor.
    * "This intensification of inner life helped the prisoner find a refuge from the emptiness, desolation and
      spiritual poverty of his existence, by letting him escape into the past.
  * Identity broke down, ego suffered a loss of values. The The circumstances were so meaningless; being used
    until physical resources were depleted, then efficiently killed, in service of men you hate.
  * Reaction to "enforced community life."
    * "The prisoner craved to be alone with himself and his thoughts. He yearned for privacy and for
      solitude."
  * When deciding on escape attempts, it was torment to have to make decisions about one's own fate. Each
    prisoner desired escape from commitment. Due to apathy and hopelessness. "Let fate run its course."
    * "I ran out of the hut and told my friend that I could not go with him. As soon as I had told him with
      finality that I had made up my mind to stay with my patients, the unhappy feeling left me. I did not
      know what the following days would bring, but I had gained an inward peace that I had never experienced
      before. I returned to the hut, sat down on the boards at my countryman's feet and tried to comfort him;
      then I chatted with the others, trying to quiet them in their delirium."
  * Damn, so close to an arbitrary death, as he was finally being released:
    * "Many weeks later we found out that even in those last hours fate had toyed with us few remaining
      prisoners. We found out just how uncertain human decisions are, especially in matters of life and death.
      I was confronted with photographs which had been taken in a small camp not far from ours. Our friends
      who had thought they were traveling to freedom that night had been taken in the trucks to this camp, and
      they were locked in the huts and burned to death. Their partially charred bodies were recognizable on
      the photograph."
  * Choosing how you respond to suffering is a meaningful freedom
    * Those generous prisoners who gave away their last piece of bread and comforted others in the infirmary
      tents: "thought few in number, they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but
      one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances,
      to choose one's own way."
    * "And there was always choices to make. Every day, every hour, offered the opportunity to make a
      decision, a decision which determined whether you would or would not submit to those powers which
      threatened to rob you of your very self, your inner freedom; which determined whether or not you would
      become the plaything of circumstance,s renouncing freedom and dignity to become molded into the form of
      the typical inmate."
    * "Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the
      moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his
      sufferings or not."
    * A life that can only demonstrate a noble attitude in the face of suffering can still be meaningful, in
      the same way that a creative life is full of meaning. It can still demonstrate dignity, unselfishness.
  * Being robbed of one's future
    * "On entering camp a chance took place in the minds of the men. With the end of uncertainty there came
      the uncertainty of the end. It was impossible to foresee whether or when, if at all, this form of
      existence would end."
    * Prisoners, in a new uncertain state of life, could no longer live for the future, because of their
      wildly uncertain present. Similar effect happens to the unemployed. Without a future and without a goal.
      A feeling of lifelessness, as if they'd already died. Everything became pointless. But this frame of
      mind robbed the prisoners of the ability to see small opportunities to grow spiritually.
      * "People forgot that often it is just such an exceptionally difficult external situation which gives
        man the opportunity to grow spiritually beyond himself."
    * "It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future."
      * Even in prison, some found a goal and strove for it.
  * The impact of hope on one's immune system
    * "The sudden loss of hope and courage can have a deadly effect."
    * Many died at Christmas. The explanation is that their disappointment at not being home by Christmas
      overcame their hope, and thus their strength to live.
  * "We had to reach the despairing men, that it did not matter what we expected from life, but rather what
    life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of
    ourselves as those who were being questioned by life -- daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in
    talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct."
  * Their task in life: to reveal their character and greatness
    * "Once the meaning of suffering had been revealed to us, we refused to minimize or alleviate the camp's
      tortures by ignoring them or harboring false illusions and entertaining artificial optimism. Suffering
      had become a task on which we did not want to turn our backs."
    * With this framing, there were "hidden opportunities for achievement" in their situation. "There's plenty
      of suffering to work through."
  * "A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits
    for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the 'why' for his
    existence, and will be able to bear almost any 'how'."
  * "I told them of a comrade who on his arrival in camp had tried to make a pact with Heaven that his
    suffering and death should save the human being he loved from a painful end. For this man, suffering and
    death were meaningful; his was a sacrifice of the deepest significance. He did not want to die for
    nothing."
  * Upon their liberation day, they did not celebrate with mad joy. They has this capability stamped out of
    them over the years of captivity. Their freedom appeared as a dream -- unreal, unlikely.
    * "We had literally lost the ability to feel pleased and had to relearn it slowly."
    * Some ate ravenously for days. Others couldn't stop talking; they desired to express themselves.
    * Some sought release by becoming oppressors of others soon after being oppressed.
  * "Woe to him who found that the person whose memory alone had given him courage in camp did not exist any
    more! Woe to him who, when the day of his dreams finally came, found it so different from all he had
    longed for!"
    * Bitterness and disillusionment plagued some. In camp, at least they had hope for something concretely
      better on the horizon. After liberation, some who went home found no one waiting for them, and there was
      no obvious next thing to hope for.
  * "The crowning experience of all, for the homecoming man, is the wonderful feeling that, after all he has
    suffered, there is nothing he need fear any more -- except his God."
* Logotherapy (part 2)
  * Logotherapy in a nutshell
    * "Logotherapy focuses rather on the future, that is to say, on the meanings to be fulfilled by the
      patient in his future."
    * Logos -- "meaning": the meaning of human existence.
    * Search for meaning is man's primary motivational force. Not the will to pleasure, nor the will to power.
    * The assignment of logotherapy is to help the patient find the meaning of his life.
    * Nietzsche: "He who has a *why* to live for can bear almost any *how*."
    * "Mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already
      achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should
      become. Such a tension is inherent in the human being."
  * The existential vacuum
    * The feeling of one's life being meaningless. This usually manifests in a state of boredom, during
      leisure hours.
    * Argues that traditions and religion have rapidly diminished in the twentieth century and this has
      deprived many of their sense of meaning.
  * The meaning of life
    * It must have a different answer for each person.
      * "To put the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess champion:
        'tell me, master, what is the best move in the world?'
    * "Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone's task is as unique as is
      his specific opportunity to implement it."
    * The question can be reversed. Each man is questioned by life: how will you add your meaning? In what
      way?
  * The essence of existence
    * "The logotherapist's role consists of widening and broadening the visual field of the patient so that
      the whole spectrum of potential meaning becomes conscious and visible to him."
      * Rather than producing a specific picture.
    * Meaning must be found outside ourselves -- in a cause, or another person, or God. The more oen forgets
      himself, the more meaning he finds.
    * Meaning of life can be discovered in three ways:
      * To create/do a deed
      * Experience something or someone
      * The attitude we take in suffering
  * The meaning of suffering
    * "We may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate
      that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its
      best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one's predicament into a human
      achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation -- just think of an incurable disease such
      as inoperable cancer -- we are challenged to change ourselves."
    * "'What would have happened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife would have had to survive you?'
      'Oh', he said, 'for her this would have been terrible; how she would have suffered!' Whereupon I
      replied, 'You see, Doctor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it was you who have spared her this
      suffering --to be sure, at the price that now you have to survive and mourn her.'"
      * (Yes, beautiful; now this man's sadness and mourning has a purpose).
  * Life's transitoriness
    * "the person who attacks the problems of life actively is like a man who removes each successive leaf
      from his calendar and files it neatly and carefully away with its predecessors, after first having
      jotted down a few diary notes on the back. He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set
      down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if
      he notices that he is growing old? Has he any reason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax
      nostalgic over his own lost youth? What reasons has he to envy a young person? For the possibilities
      that a young person has, the future which is in store for him? 'No, thank you', he will think. 'Instead
      of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but
      of sufferings bravely suffered. These sufferings are even the things of which I am most proud, though
      these are things which cannot inspire envy.'"
  * Logotherapy as a technique
    * "Pleasure is, and mus remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to
      which it is made a goal in itself."
      * "Hyper intention" defeats the goal, making it harder to achieve.
    * Paradoxical intention: overcome a fear or obsession by acting out the opposite, willingly. E.g. go pick
      up a spider if you're afraid of spiders. It defeats it of its power.
    * How much attention you give something determines its power over you.
      * "A similar chain of events can be observed in obsessive-compulsive cases in which the patient fights
        the ideas which haunt him. Thereby, however, he increases their power to disturb him, since pressure
        precipitates counterpressure."
  * The collective neurosis
    * "Every age (generation) has its own collective neurosis, and every age needs its own psychotherapy to
      cope with it."
    * A case against nihilism
      * "Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the
        next moment."
  * The psychiatric credo:
    * "An incurably psychotic individual may lose his usefulness but yet retain the dignity of a human being.
      This is my psychiatric credo. Without it I should not think it worthwhile to be a psychiatrist. For
      whose sake? Just for the sake of a damaged brain machine which cannot be repaired? If the patient were
      not definitely more, euthanasia would be justified."
    * "Our generation is realistic, for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being
      who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas
      chambers upright, with the Lord's Payer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips."
* The case for tragic optimism
  * An optimism in the face of pain, guilt, death.
  * You cannot search for happiness directly. You must search for a root reason to be happy/fulfilled. Which
    can come even in the simple pleasure of life's struggle.
    * "Once an individual's search for a meaning is successful, it not only renders him happy but also gives
      him the capability to cope with suffering."
    * "In the concentration camps, this behavior was paralleled by those who one morning, at five, refused to
      get up and go to work and instead stayed in the hut, on the straw wet with urine and feces. Nothing --
      neither warnings nor threats -- could induce them to change their minds. And then something typical
      occurred: they took out a cigarette from deep down in a pocket where they had hidden it and started
      smoking. At that moment we knew that for the next forty-eight hours or so we would watch them dying."
      * (Horrific... the swift loss of meaning and the decision to end life. How bleak must life have looked?)
  * The existential vacuum: "People have enough to live by but nothing to live for; they have the means but no
    meaning."
  * The most powerful argument in favor of a tragic optimism is the "defiant power of the human spirit."
    * "If one cannot change a situation that causes his suffering, he can still choose his attitude. Long (a
      cripple) had not chosen to break his neck, but he did decide not to let himself be broken by what had
      happened to him."
  * For criminals, if offering them excuses for their behavior to choose from, it robs them of their
    responsibility, and their power to have chosen differently. The author claims that the prisoners he's
    encountered instead want to be heard and understood, and to be culpable.
  * "Don't confound dignity with usefulness"
    * "From this one may see that there is no reason to pity old people. Instead, young people should envy
      them. It is true that the old have no opportunities, no possibilities in the future. But they have more
      than that. Instead of possibilities in the future, they have realities in the past -- the potentialities
      they have actualized, the meanings they have fulfilled, the values they have realized -- and nothing and
      nobody can ever remove these assets from the past."
  * The meaning of his life is to help others find the meaning of theirs.
