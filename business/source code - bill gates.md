* Prologue
  * Gates was hiking through the mountains as part of a troupe of five teenagers for seven days at a
    stretch. He was self-sufficient and confident.
  * As a teenager, "I had started to feel a clear longing to figure out what my path would be... it
    had to be something interesting and consequential."
  * Programming and hiking both felt like adventures: autonomy; going places that adults couldn't
    reach.
* Trey (chap 1)
  * His grandmother gave him the nick name Trey. Her family members were avid card players and she
    was the best.
  * His grandparents were devout Christian Scientists.
  * After his maternal grandfather died, his grandmother was frequently present in his life and had
    a deep effect on his development.
  * Card playing: he learned the satisfaction of competitive play, and that mastery of these games
    can be earned with careful study.
  * "Rocking was like a metronome for my brain"
  * At 4: hyperkinetic, tempestuous kid. Interested in reading and math. Resisted life skills and
    chores.
  * "My mom was meticulous about keeping records of her life, photo albums of family trips and
    school musicals, scrapbooks of newspaper clippings and telegrams."
  * His maternal grandfather: he started from nothing, failed at a few stretches, but ultimately
    founded a bank, served as mayor, and was a director of the federal reserve. Her family was wealthy
    and civic-minded.
  * Paternal grandfather: "A workaholic who left little time for much else in his life." He owned a
    furniture store which just barely got by, so it held him hostage.
  * His father was drafted for WWII in his freshman year. THe officer training was extracting, but
    he stuck with it, and it drove his transition from youth to manhood.
  * "My mother was the first person to extend her hand, welcome you, and smooth your way into the
    group in a room. The minister of our church once said that my mother 'never met an unimportant
    person.'"
  * His parents garduate from UW, and Gates is born 3 (?) years later. They move from Seattle to a
    suburb still under construction.
* View Ridge (chap 2)
