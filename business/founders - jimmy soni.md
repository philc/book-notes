# Founders - Jimmy Soni

## Gems

* Levchin and Thiel hiring so many technical, high-IQ people at PayPal:
  * "So maybe it was groupthink, but for a small group of people to achieve something and achieve it
    really fast, it was actually, in hindsight, a masterful thing to do."
* Thiel: "friends-turned-employees came preinstalled with trust. Trust produced speed."
* Balancing velocity versus groupthink
  * "A good rule of thumb is that diversity of opinion is essential anytime you don't know anything
    about something important. But if there's a strong sense of what's right already, don't argue
    about it." - Max
* The opinion Confinity developed about the value of PR: "It was much more important for recruiting
  and for perception among investors than it is about actual product adoption."
* Levchin on pitching your startup against Google: "To win, you need to tell a story about cogs. At
  Google, you're a cog. Whereas with me, you're an instrumental piece of this great thing that we'll
  build together. Articulate the vision."
* "It's important to take feedback from your environment. You want to be as closed-loop as
  possible." - Musk
* "I kind of became, like, 'Dr. No.' Because I'd always have to say no to everyone's stupid ideas...
  it was really important that we not squander our precious engineering bandwidth on ideas that
  didn't make sense for the long-term strategy of the company." - Sacks
* "Thiel abhorred bureaucracies, and now that Confinity was growing, he risked being ensnared by the
  very things he had abandoned upon leaving law firm life -- management, paperwork, meetings. 'Peter
  is even less tolerant of bullshit than I am,' the famously administrivia-averse Musk remarked. 'My
  bullshit tolerance is low, but Peter is like zero.'"
* "Great, I don't want to be CEO. I had no desire to be CEO. It's really a lot of chores... being
  CEO sucks." - Musk
* CEO transition
  * "2x problem" post-merger
    * "CEO Bill Harris bore the brunt of the blame for the slowdown. 'He never solved the 2x
      problem,' one executive recalled, alluding to the talent duplication following mergers."
  * "Sacks shared Musk's view that post-merger growth and development had slowed to a rate that
    risked the operation's future. Harris's imposition of additional meetings, formality, and
    process, he believed, came at the expense of releasing new features."
  * "X.com's leaders took Bill Harris's rocky tenure as evidence that such 'supervision' was not
    only unnecessary, but counterproductive. For every Schmidt-like success, there seemed to be a
    John Sculley waiting in the wings."
  * Musk was skeptical that a wizened adult figure (Harris) was needed to whip young companies into
    shape:
    * "The founder may be bizarre and erratic but this is a creative force, and they should run the
      company... If someone's the creative force, or one of the creative forces, behind a company,
      at least they understand which direction to go. Maybe they don't run the ship perfectly. The
      ship may be a little erratic, and the morale may be mixed. And some parts of the ship aren't
      working that well. But it's going in the actual right direction. Or you can have a ship that
      has everything buttoned down. The sails are full. Morale is great. Everyoen's cheering. And
      it's heading straight for the reef."
* "Both had observed an irksome startup paradox: as X.com had grown in size, it began to accomplish
  less work of substance."
* "Another engineer knocked Microsoft as having been 'written because it solved an existing
  problem... if you have these off-the-shelf tools that will just work for you, then you're not
  doing something that's new and interesting and unseen.'"
* "Confinity didn't have interns in the traditional sense: Levchin preferred his teams small and his
  engineers self-reliant. He wasn't about to tutor a college student."
* "'[The IPO underwriters] were like, "You guys have to have more seasoned execs on here. We can't
  take this to our clients,"' Woolway remembered. 'And we said, "Nope. This is the team we have."
* "David Sacks told his product team that it wasn't clear who the 'victor' would have been if the
  two companies had continued fighting it out. 'In these cases, if it's clear, then a deal usually
  cannot be stuck' he explained ot his team, per Eric Jackson's recounting. 'Victors wouldn't want
  to be acquired because they'd know they were going to win, and losers wouldn't be able to convince
  anyone to acquire them.'"
* "So, suddenly, which industries you might possibly go at becomes a much broader scope as a
  function of our experience at PayPal." - Reid Hoffman
  * "Amy Rowe Klement echoed the sentiment: 'If not us, then who?'"
* Musk on having an obsessive customer experience: "That was a far more effective selling tool than
  having a giant sales force or marketing gimmicks or twelve-step processes or whatever."

## Intro

* "During its first two years of existence, PayPal cycled through three CEOs, and its senior
  management team threatened to resign en masse -- twice."
* "Just over two years passed between the X.com-Confinity merger and PayPal's initial public
  offering on the Nasdaq, but many employees felt as though they'd worked a lifetime."
* "Several said they did their life's finest work during this period."
  * Unforgivingly intense, and remembered with pride and fondness.
* "Ecology of talent": Bell Labs, Google, Florence.
  * "As he looked into these revolutionaries, he discovered them to be products of 'very fertile
    scenes involving lots and lots of people -- some of them artists, some of them collectors, some
    of them curators, thinkers, theorists... all sorts of people who created a kind of ecology of
    talent."
  * "Scenius" instead of solo genius.

## Building blocks (chap 1)

* Levchin learned programming as a kid in the Ukraine helping his mom detect radiation in food.
  Emigrated to Chicago when he was 16; Ukraine was hostile to Jews. Had little money.
* UIUC undergrad. Hallmark of his intensity.
  * "Levchin soon became consumsed by the world wide web and found networks and forums full of
    kindred digital spirits."
* Marc Andreessen was from UIUC; he did Mosiac while there and then started Netsacpe.
* "One thing that really shaped me -- and probably a lot of other people at Illinois -- was this
  constant sense of opportunity in the air because Mosaic and subsequently Netscape." - Levchin

## The pitch (chap 2)

* Thiel: Stanford undergrad, law grad. Launched Stanford Review newspaper as a student.
* Started a hedge fund after law school.
* Levchin and Thiel hiring so many technical, high-IQ people at PayPal:
  * "So maybe it was groupthink, but for a small group of people to achieve something and achieve it
    really fast, it was actually, in hindsight, a masterful thing to do."

## The right questions (chap 3)

* "Musk transferred from Queen's to the University of Pennsylvania and pursued dual degrees in
  physics and finance."
* "Musk admitted to studying business as a hedge. 'I was concerned that if I didn't study business,
  I would be forced to work for someone who did study business.'"
* Musk loved video games and built them as a kid.
* "From where he sat, the brains behind Yahoo and Amazon were just a few years older than him and
  surely no wiser. But starting his own venture still felt risky, particularly with a Stanford
  graduate school acceptance in hand."
* Musk: go through with the Stanford graduate program, or join the tech boom?
  * "I would spend several years watching the internet go through this incredibly rapid grwoth phase
    and that would be really difficult to handle -- so I really wanted to be doing something."
* Started a company called Global Link with his brother and got $3.5M VC in a few months. How is
  that possible?
  * "Musk slept at the office and showered at a nearby YMCA."
* Zip2, Musk's first company, provided local listings and maps to newspaper websites and media
  companies. He wanted to compete directly with Yahoo but his colleagues had lower ambitions. He was
  changed from CEO to CTO because he was too abrasive to his coworkers. In Feb 1999, sold the
  company to Compaq (who owned Altavista) for $300M cash! Age 27.

## What matters to me is winning (chap 4)

* "His first impression of Musk 'Very high energy,' Payne remembered. 'Very much let's go, let's get
  going and do something, build something, achieve something.'"
* Musk's home: "'The room was literally filled with books -- biographies or stories about business
  luminaries and how they succeeded,' Payne said, 'In fact, I remember sitting there and at the top
  of this stack was a book about Richard Branson. It kind of clicked to me that Elon was prepping
  himself and studying to be a famous entrepreneur.'"
* His email address: e@x.com
* Musk didn't want VC because he wanted full control, and self-funded much of x.com initially.
* X.com wanted to be an internet bank but regulatory work was slow and high-overhead.
* Musk: "You start off with an idea, and that idea is mostly wrong. And then you adapt that idea and
  keep refining it and you listen to criticism. And then engage in sort of a recursive
  self-improvement... keep iterating on a loop that says,, 'Am I doing something useful for other
  people?' Because that's what a company is supposed to do."
  * "too much precision in early plans, he believed, cut that iteration loop prematurely."
* Musk fired his cofounder (a finance guy), and then his other co-founder (product guy) left also as
  a result.
* "Two decades later, Musk offered only brief reflections on the early chaos at X.com, calling it 'a
  hot minute' in PayPal's history. 'There's always drama in start-ups' he said."

## The beamers (chap 5)

* On Thiel taking the CEO position at Confinity
  * "He had no interests in a CEO's administrative and managerial duties -- he preferred sticking to
    markets and money."
  * "Thiel could also see the value in operating experience -- time in the CEO chair could fine-tune
    his investor antennae."
* "There were downsides to [their hiring] approach, too, of course. Hiring friends risked a
  cloistered, exclusionary monoculture and made it excpetionally hard to let people go."
* Thiel: "friends-turned-employees came preinstalled with trust. Trust produced speed."
* "Brilliance, nonconformity, availability, and the willing suspension of disbelief -- these
  qualities defined Confinity's first hires and formed the foundation of its culture."
  * (Availability... spare bandwidth in their lives. Because no one was old or successful yet.)
* (Their initial focus -- beaming money around via Palm Pilot's -- was all wrong. They iterated on
  their idea, the pitch, the extrapolation of their market... how much energy did they spend on that
  stuff? Was it worthwhile? Contrasted against something so clear and correct, like Google's vision,
  or Microsoft's).
* 100 pitches to SV venture firms, all failed. Finally landed $4.5M from Nokia, who wanted to make a
  bet on mobile payments.
* "They told Buhl that Levchin was the 'real deal.' 'In a way', said Buhl, 'the real insurance
  policy was how incredible Max was by reputation.'"

## Hosed (chap 6)

* Ironic: "Throughout the spring and early summer of 1999, Confinity and X.com occupied adjoining
  office suites at 394 University Avenue in Palo Alto."
* The opinion Confinity developed about the value of PR: "It was much more important for recruiting
  and for perception among investors than it is about actual product adoption."
* On choosing a catchy name: "If people don't konw how to say something, or if they are fearful of
  saying it incorrectly, they will do anything to avoid saying it. Embarrassment is a very strong
  emotion."
* Levchin on pitching your startup against Google: "To win, you need to tell a story about cogs. At
  Google, you're a cog. Whereas with me, you're an instrumental piece of this great thing that we'll
  build together. Articulate the vision."
* "Max kept repeating, 'As hire As. Bs hire Cs. So the first B you hire takes the whole company
  down.'"
* The Palm Pilot beaming transaction didn't even settle until it was later docked to a desktop. How
  did they think this idea was viable?
* Max, about things like the selection of the core programming language: "Anyone that did want to
  argue about it wouldn't have fit in. Arguing would have impeded progress."
* Balancing velocity versus groupthink
  * "A good rule of thumb is that diversity of opinion is essential anytime you don't know anything
    about something important. But if there's a strong sense of what's right already, don't argue
    about it." - Max
* Chad Hurley, future founder of YouTube, joined as a graphic designer out of college.
* They stumbled upon using their website to allow users to email money, to satisfy the use case when
  they forgot their Palm Pilots.
* When Sacks invterviewed by invitation of Thiel, he was unafraid to trash the product during his
  interview.

## Money talks (chap 7)

* Musk was influenced by Amazon's success of being a superstore. He set the X.com strategy to be the
  same thing for financial services.
* "Debora Bezona had seen her share of companies as a benefits consultant, and when she signed X.com
  on as a client, she remarked that it was 'the most diverse company I had ever worked with."
  (Compared to Confinity, which was all 20-something males).
* "Musk gave employees ample freedom -- 'the room to be everything they could be' -- but set
  palpably high expectations for performance. 'I have never worked so hard and fast in all my life'
  Bezona said."
* "'Instead of writing everything yourself, we should use frameworks. You can get a lot more done in
  a little time.' Musk supported the decision to switch to the Microsoft stack because it swapped
  flexibility for efficiency."

## If you build it (chap 8)

* Both Confinity and X.com grew like wildfire after launch. Both teams lived at the office.
* "The explosion of interest was exhausting yet energizing."
* "It's important to take feedback from your environment. You want to be as closed-loop as
  possible." - Musk
* Sacks became Confinity's first head of product.
* "I kind of became, like, 'Dr. No.' Because I'd always have to say no to everyone's stupid ideas...
  it was really important that we not squander our precious engineering bandwidth on ideas that
  didn't make sense for the long-term strategy of the company." - Sacks
* The growth innovation was a cash referral bonus for inviting friends.
  * "In time, this bonus effort was hailed as one of the all-time great 'viral marketing' programs."
* "Thiel abhorred bureaucracies, and now that Confinity was growing, he risked being ensnared by the
  very things he had abandaoned upon leaving law firm life -- management, paperwork, meetings.
  'Peter is even less tolerant of bullshit than I am,' the famously administrivia-averse Musk
  remarked. 'My bullshit tolerance is low, but Peter is like zero.'"
* "Great, I don't want to be CEO. I had no desire to be CEO. It's really a lot of chores... being
  CEO sucks." - Musk

## The widget wars (chap 9)

* "Network effects trump everything else" and Paypal got to email payments first, and to eBay.
* "Given a teetering market and a take-no-prisoners competitor, Thiel and others in the company
  began considring an alternative course. 'A lot of us came to the conclusion that this would be a
  winner-take-all market, and that this should be a single company. Or both of us would spend
  ourselves into oblivion."
* X.com's initial offer for Paypal was 92/8% releative valuation!
  * Final relval was 50-50.
* Elon wasn't excited: "To put Confinity on par with his own company was bad enough, but especially
  so when he considered X.com's lead in non-eBay accounts. He wasn't overly worried about market
  trends, user growth, burn rate, or the competitive landscape -- X.com could have won through will
  and skill."
* "The reason I agreed to the fity-fity is because Bill Harris (his CEO) said he would resign if I
  didn't. Otherwise, I was going to pass on the deal." (This was during a crucial fundraise, and
  would've torpedoed the fundraise).
* "Shotgun wedding" merger.

## Crash (chap 10)

* 100s of new users each hour, backlog of complaints, complicated merger, different techs, and
  actively fundraising!
* $8M burn per month for the merged company.
* Thiel hustled to close the fund raise before the bubble burst.
* The ankle-biting competitors in payments suddenly died off when the dot-com crash happened.
* "If the team hadn't closed that one hundred million, there would be no SpaceX, no LinkedIn, and no
  Tesla." - Woolworth, X.com's CEO.

## The nut house coup (chap 11)

* Using family in Nebraska to stand up customer service.
  * "Anderson thought of her sister, Jill Harriman, who lived in Nebraska and whose Midwest patience
    she believed would offer a strong antidote to simmering user frustration. Musk saw promise.
    'Just go hog wild,' he remembers telling her. 'Get a building and just go. We need a hundred
    people in thirty days.'"
* On being accepting of failure on the path to success:
  * "If you can't tell me the four ways you fucked something up... before you got it right, you
    probably weren't the person who worked on it." - Elon
* "If there were two paths where we had to choose one thing or the other, and one wasn't obviously
  better than the other, then rather than spend a lot of time trying to figure out which one was
  slightly better, we would just pick one and do it. And sometimes we'd be wrong... but oftentimes
  it's better to just pick a path and do it rather than just vacillate endlessly on the choice."
* "Those in or near the executive ranks had grown accustomed to small, informal meetings,
  particularly at Confinity. But at the new X.com, lengthy meetings became a fact of life. 'We would
  attend these exec meetings where you've got twenty-plus people in a room!' remembers an
  exasperated Sacks."
* "2x problem" post-merger
  * "CEO Bill Harris bore the brunt of the blame for the slowdown. 'He never solved the 2x problem,'
    one executive recalled, alluding to the talent duplication following mergers."
* "Harris was also a decidely nontechnical CEO. By his own admission, this presented challenges at
  engineering-focused X.com."
* X.com was at the mercy of eBay. One policy decision could wipe them out.
* Harris was focusing on user growth, but the rest of leadership believed revenue growth was the
  core problem. They were already growing virally.
* On Thiel wanting to depart: "The company would be fine without him in an operational role -- and
  more importantly, he would be better off without the encumberances of executive life."
* "Musk also blanched at the CEO's desire to hire more business and finance heavies. 'He was going
  to "tame us young whippersnappers" with these, like seasoned financial executives or whatever. And
  we're like, "Uh, these are the same seasoned executives at these banks who can't do jack, who
  can't compete with us? Doesn't make sense."'"
* "Sacks shared Musk's view that post-merger growth and development had slowed to a rate that risked
  the operation's future. Harris's imposition of additional meetings, formality, and process, he
  believed, came at the expense of releasing new features."
* "X.com's leaders took Bill Harris's rocky tenure as evidence that such 'supervision' was not only
  unnecessary, but counterproductive. For every Schmidt-like success, there seemed to be a John
  Sculley waiting in the wings."
* Musk was skeptical that a wizened adult figure (Harris) was needed to whip young companies into
  shape:
  * "The founder may be bizarre and erratic but this is a creative force, and they should run the
    company... If someone's the creative force, or one of the creative forces, behind a company, at
    least they understand which direction to go. Maybe they don't run the ship perfectly. The ship
    may be a little erratic, and the morale may be mixed. And some parts of the ship aren't working
    that well. But it's going in the actual right direction. Or you can have a ship that has
    everything buttoned down. The sails are full. Morale is great. Everyoen's cheering. And it's
    heading straight for the reef."

## Button up (chap 12)

* "Both had observed an irksome startup paradox: as X.com had grown in size, it began to accomplish
  less work of substance."
* "The word *manager* had acquired this negative connotation. To call them 'product managers' would
  imply that their job was just to 'manage things' as opposed to 'make things happen.'" - Sacks
  * So PMs were called "producers."
* Output vs. employee happiness
  * "In the view of X.com's leaders, growing organizations often made a crucial mistake: employee
    happiness became a bigger concern than output. Its leaders feared X.com would fall into the same
    trap, and to avoid it, company leaders set a cultural tone of impatience. They sacrified
    solidarity for speed and made decisions by fiat when necessary. 'It wasn't an open democracy of
    ideas,' recalled early X.com engineer and later Yelp cofounder Jeremy Stoppelman."
* They developed the idea of two deposits into an account to verify its ownership.
  * "David Sacks captured the idea's elegant simplicity in his launch announcement, calling it 'an
    idea that, like )velcro, you wish you had thought of.'"

## The sword (chap 13)

* "David Sacks said that we had the sword of Damocles hanging over our head the whole time." The
  sword was eBay, who could crush them at any time.
* "The two eng teams remained separate, and operated two websites. Musk wanted to rewrite Paypal on
  MS Windows.
  * (He should have known better. He should have known this would cause a mutiny).
* Musk said "Linux in 2000 was very primitive. It didn't have much support... so why the fuck are we
  using Linux?"
  * MS Windows also offered a recruiting advantage for hiring engineers.
* "Another engineer knocked Microsoft as having been 'written because it solved an existing
  problem... if you have these off-the-shelf tools that will just work for you, then you're not
  doing something that's new and interesting and unseen.'"
* X.com's MS Windows servers needed to reboot every 13 seconds, due to memory leaks!
* The Windows rewrite didn't go well
  * "During those several months, the company lost millions to fraud. 'If you're spending that time
    fixing memory leads,' one QA analyst remarked, 'you're not solving the problem that's causing
    $30 million in loss.'"
* Max's team had an aversion for windows, despite any valid technical arguments
  * "With its open-source codebase and hacker roots, Liux reflected personal preference as much as
    architectural choice -- and made it hard to sawllow a changeover to a closed-source system built
    by a massive, multibillion-dollar corporation."
  * "I'm just going to leave, Levchin remembered thinking. This V2 thing is just destroying my will
    to live."

## Ambition's debt (chap 14)

* "Messy though it was, Musk's ouster from X.com gave him creative breathing room. Freed of X.com
  duties, he could return to his earliest passions: space exploration and electrical energy. 'Steve
  Jobs made Pixar great because he was fired from Apple,' observed early X.com engineer Scott
  Alexander. 'Elon did SpaceX and made Tesla great because he was fired from X.com.'"

## Igor (chap 15)

* Thiel was contrarian, appointing and betting on people based on talent rather than experience.
* A round table after the coup:
  * "with Musk out, the company was now theirs. But so were its crises. Thiel divided up
    responsibility to those in attendance for combating each of the existential threats."
* Wow, Paypal/Levchin were the first to develop and use a CAPTCHA, to deter signups by bots, who
  wanted to steal the $20 signup bonus.
* "'Peter called it the dials,' Sacks remebered. 'It's easy to stop fraud if you're willing to kill
  usability. What's hard is maintaining a sufficient level of usability without letting fraud get
  out of control. So Max controlled the fraud dial. I controlled the usability dial. And we'd come
  together to agree on a compromise.'"
* "During this period, the company's leadership built what Sacks called 'the tight, iterative loop
  between product and finance.' Weekly weekend meetings became the norm, and the company watched
  each adjustment of the dials closely.'"
* Two-fold strategy of preventing fraud at the "front door" (gates) vs. "back door" (detection).
* "Confinity didn't have interns in the traditional sense: Levchin preferred his teams small and his
  engineers self-reliant. He wasn't about to tutor a college student."
* They converted the fraud problem to a tractable, mathematical problem.
* "PayPal's use of random forests, for instance, was among the world's first applications of that
  learning method for a commercial purpose."

## Use the force (chap 16)

* On upselling sellers to business accounts: "Human beings are creatures of momentum, and finding
  ways to change the default (behaviors, thinking, narrative, etc.) can result in massive change." -
  Amy Rowe Klement.
* "The outages still caused panicky all-nighters, but unlike in the early months, the company felt
  users were more forgiving. At this point, they needed PayPal as much as PayPal needed them."

## Guerrillas (chap 18

* Sacks formed an "ebay response team" -- cross functional group to work on the PayPal competitive
  threat.
* There was a "fiery independent streak within the eBay seller community. 'There were some sellers
  that didn't like giving eBay as much power over their business as it had... [using PayPal] was an
  opportunity to be a little more independent from eBay.'"
* "The community liked PayPal. The community was successful with PayPal. We didn't like it -- but it
  was what our community wanted." - eBay's Rob Chestnut

## World domination (chap 19)

* "For Musk, Thiel, and other PayPal executives, urgency was the default posture on all things --
  including and especially its international expansion campaign."
* Got funding post-dotcom crash by cutting BD deals with a major bank in every region to have them
  be PayPal's exclusive partner in that region. But they had no intention of leveraging that bank
  abroad -- they just wanted the war chest so they could win the domestic battle.
* PayPal's conquesting recipe
  * "Sacks estimated that it took the company three months of pre-launch preparation and an
    aggressive post-launch sales and marketing effort to conquer a new market. Thus, whenever
    possible, PayPal would explore markets that '(1) are relatively proximate to our existing
    territory in terms of functionality and (2) have a strong need for our service because they are
    under-served by existing options.'"

## Blindsided (chap 20)

* "Thiel had concerns about the IPO. '[Thiel] just kept saying, "I don't want to run a public
  company. I [have] no desire to be a public CEO. I'd rather do other things. I don't want to go
  public,"' Knight recalled. 'He convinced me. I didn't think it was any more complicated than
  that.'"
* Nov 18 1999 -> Feb 2 2000: from 1,000 userse to 100,000 users. Apr 15 2000: 1M users!
* "Peter was right to sideline them. The investment bankers just got in the way of PayPal's
  success."
* "Thiel raged about the media's coverage at the office. 'It really pissed Peter off,' engineer Russ
  Simmons remembered. 'And he gave this speech in front of the whole company talking about how they
  were idiots and we were going to prove them wrong. That's one fo the times when I've seen him most
  fired up.'"

## Outlaws (chap 21)

* "'[The IPO underwriters] were like, "You guys have to have more seasoned execs on here. We can't
  take this to our clients,"' Woolway remembered. 'And we said, "Nope. This is the team we have."
* From the middle of January through early February, PayPal faced two lawsuits, the threat of a
  third, the Louisana ban, license inquiries from California and New York, the Gartner survey flap,
  and skeptical investors. These stiff headwinds had delayed the IPO from Feb 6 to Feb 15."
* People were super skeptical leading up to the IPO, but the IPO had a 55% pop on the first day.
* "With his holdings, Musk's grub stake was now worth more than $100 million." .The company was
  valued at $1B.
* "PayPal going public is what allowed me to have the capital to start SpaceX, because I could sell
  stock or borrow against the stock. Before that, I didn't really have meaningful cash." - Musk

## And all I got was a T-shirt (chap 22)

* PayPal crashing eBay's customer conference. Awesome... so aggressive.
* "The IPO was incredibly helpful to the deal, because there was a mark."
* "David Sacks told his product team that it wasn't clear who the 'victor' would have been if the
  two companies had continued fighting it out. 'In these cases, if it's clear, then a deal usually
  cannot be stuck' he explained ot his team, per Eric Jackson's recounting. 'Victors wouldn't want
  to be acquired because they'd know they were going to win, and losers wouldn't be able to convince
  anyone to acquire them.'"
* "In the final analysis, the eBay sale was another in the company's rich history of risk-mitigation
  tactics. The list included merging, cutting bonus payments, fighting fraud, and even going public.
  From one angle, PayPal's success was an exercise in careful hedging as much as it was in
  innovating -- and the sale to eBay was simply the latest hedge."

## The floor (conclusion)

* Most PayPal execs were planning to leave post acquisition. eBay did not want them to stay; they
  had their own talent. Thiel left right after the deal closed.
* "PayPayl proved to its founders that talented outsiders could upend an industry"
* "So, suddenly, which industries you might possibly go at becomes a much broader scope as a
  function of our experience at PayPal." - Reid Hoffman
  * "Amy Rowe Klement echoed the sentiment: 'If not us, then who?'"
* Hiring for inexperience
  * Lauri Schultheis: "When we were looking to hire people for fraud, we were actually trying to
    find people that didn't have experience with fraud, because we didn't want them to have
    preconceived notions about what they would be doing at PayPal.. We wanted them to be able to
    pivot and think outside the box and look at things from a different perspective, instead of
    saying, 'Well, you know, at such-and-such bank, this is how we did it, and that's how we should
    do it here.'"
* Musk on having an obsessive customer experience: "That was a far more effective selling tool than
  having a giant sales force or marketing gimmicks or twelve-step processes or whatever."
* Sacks as the product leader was obsessed with distribution
