# Better Simpler Strategy - Felix Oberholzer-Gee

## Gems

* The idea that the pair of WTS (willingness to sell) and WTP (willingness to pay) is a radically
  simple model which helps focus everyone's activities.
  * "Unless an activity increases WTP or decreases WTS, it will not contribute to the firm's
    competitive standing. When I visit companies, I am always impressed by the myriad of activities
    I observe. At the same time, I often find myself at a loss to see how certain initiatives will
    help increase WTP or decrease WTS."
* Firms should focus first on value creation, and solve value distribution -- to customers,
  employees, or shareholders -- as a secondary problem.
  * "An obsession with business models -- how you capture value -- is particularly risky, because
    value capture is a zero-sum game." (versus focusing primarily on WTP).

## Simpler, better (chap 1)

* "As our strategic initiatives multiply, something unforeseen happens. In concentrating on all the
  trees, we lose sight of the forest."
* "In this world, strategic planning becomes an annual ritual that feels bureaucratic and less than
  helpful in resolving critical issues."
* "When no one knows when to say no, most ideas (brought forward by talented and ambitious
  employees) seem like good ideas. And when most ideas seem like good ideas, we end up in...
  hyperactivity."
* Framework:
  * Value is the delta between a customer's willingness-to-pay (WTP) and the firm's
    willingness-to-sell (WTS)
  * (This framework seems overly simple. Most hard strategic questions center on risk, achieving a
    monopoly and locking out competition.)
* "Think value, not profit, and profit will follow."
* "Value drivers are the criteria that make up WTP and WTS. They are the product and service
  attributes that are important to your customers."
  * Strategy should focus on a small number of these, and make them explicit.
* "Accomplished strategists are comfortable promoting only a few value drivers and withholding
  resources from many others. How did Paul Buchheit, Gmail's lead developer, express this idea? 'If
  your product is great, it doesn't need to be good.'"
* Firms should focus first on value creation, and solve value distribution -- to customers,
  employees, or shareholders -- as a secondary problem.

## A sea of opportunities (chap 2)

* In short, we should be optimistic about the number of opportunities to create significant value,
  because there exists such large variance in companies in the same industry, no matter the
  industry.
* "Some industries are blessed with high average returns, others decidedly less so. Take, for
  instance, US insurance, a highly competitive industry. Mean returns are close to zero (1.2
  percent); the median insurance company destroys substantial value."
  * (It seems that simply picking a rising industry to start a company makes it much easier to
    perform well.)
* Argues that a firm should focus on its competitive place within an industry, rather than changing
  industries, to achieve the largest/easiest impact on profitability.
  * "From the standpoint of profitability, industries are fairly similar. Companies inside an
    industry, however, tend to be very different."
* ROIC for all top companies declines over time. It's difficult/impossible to stay ahead as scale
  grows.

## Think value, not profit (chap 3)

* One can focus on value capture, but that should come after value creation. The author argues that
  value creation should be the primary focus of a business.
* "Unless an activity increases WTP or decreases WTS, it will not contribute to the firm's
  competitive standing. When I visit companies, I am always impressed by the myriad of activities I
  observe. At the same time, I often find myself at a loss to see how certain initiatives will help
  increase WTP or decrease WTS."
* The visualization tool used in the book is "value sticks." Ascii example:
  * WTS |- wholesale price given to retailers -- firm's margin -- price given to consumers -| WTP
* He argues that this framework is valuable because it greatly simplifies. It focuses the business
  on just two levers.
* "If the value stick of a business closely resembles the value stick of other businesses, how do
  you suppose customers choose? They will focus on price, putting pressure on margins and reducing
  the firm's ability to capture the value it creates."
  * E.g. airline carriers.
* "Strategists think in differences. Exceptional product quality and outstanding working conditions
  do not confer a lasting advantage if they can be matched easily by rival firms."

## Claps and cheers - creating customer delight (chap 4)

* Focusing on WTP means focusing on creating customer delight in a broad sense, not just on the
  specific product quality and its price. The goal is to deliver deep satisfaction.
* The Amazon "press release first" development model puts first the act of defining the customer and
  how you will increase their WTP.
* "An obsession with business models -- how you capture value -- is particularly risky, because
  value capture is a zero-sum game." (versus focusing primarily on WTP).

## Hiding in plain sight (near-customers) (chap 5)

* Near customers are similar to customers you're currently selling to, but you can't yet address
  them because their WTP is too low. They may have a lower WTP because of misperceptions or lack of
  education about the product.

## Looking for helpers - winning with complements (chap 6)

* "Products and services that raise the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for another product are called
  complements" (or "helpers"). E.g. smartphones, with app stores full of apps.
* "Complements are particularly powerful if they raise the WTP for your product specifically.
  Apple's FaceTime application raises the WTP for iPhones and not for Android devices."
* Examples:
  * Alibaba Taobao and Alipay
  * Amazon and Kindle (promotion of ebooks)
  * Michelin and tire guides
  * Dunkin Donuts and selling coffee
  * Tesla and its supercharger network
* Michelin's guide was not a specific complement; it helped all tire merchants
  * "If you want to grow the category -- a rising tide lifts all boats -- non-proprietary,
    industry-level complements suit your needs best. If your goal is to gain market share,
    proprietary complements are more powerful."
* Can anyone afford to dilute their focus by pushing complement products? The author argues that
  one's focus should be WTP -- customer delight -- and increasing that can include developing
  complements.
* It's hard for firms to see potential complements. Movie theaters focus on better seats, but what
  about onsite childcare?
  * "Identifying them requires you to think creatively about customer journeys."
* Companies who provide complementary products for each other often battle over capturing a larger
  share of the mutual value created.
* "The ability to move pools of profit from intensely competitive domains to calmer waters is one of
  the great benefits of producing complements in-house and controlling their supply, as Apple does."
  * From hardware, and now to software and app fees.

## Tipping points (chap 8)

* Network effects drive up WTP as other customers adopt the product.
* E.g. more establishments accepting cashless payments -> higher consumer WTP for cashless payments
* Many network effects are per-region. E.g. many countries have their own messaging app.
* Adoption of the service increases WTP, but often with diminishing returns, which result in "value
  thresholds."
* Argues that network effects can be added to an industry which seemingly doesn't have them, to
  strengthen the business. Like FaceTime, and UberPool.
* Competitors or suppliers who manage to establish a network effect will shrink your margins, so you
  must see it early and beat or buy them. OpenTable ate restaurants' margins.

## Strategies for underdogs (chap 9)

* How to compete with businesses that have network effects
  * Increase customer delight in ways that don't depend on scale.
  * Focus on the unfavored/unloved customer type.
  * Focus on a smaller set of customers..
* Note that in industries with network effects like online auction aggregators (ebay), each store
  added to their site adds decreasing marginal utility to buyers. So a new entrant can climb the WTP
  curve quickly with much less scale, because the early stores added to the platform have higher
  marginal utility. If that firm's WTP ends up being higher than the incumbent's due to some other
  advantage, then they can feasibly overtake the incumbent even if the incumbent has a preexisting
  network effect.
  * E.g. Taobao crushing eBay despite its established network effects.
* "As powerful as network effects can be, it is important to remember that WTP and customer delight
  are the currency that ultimately counts. In this sense, there is nothing magical about network
  effects. An increase in WTP that results form network effects is no more valuable than increases
  in WTP that reflect great ideas, a more pleasant customer experience, or less-expensive
  complements."
* Favoring one group on the platform: Etsy favoring sellers; Amazon favoring buyers.
  * "It is always worth asking whether you might be able to create meaningful differentiation by
    focusing on the WTP of the group that is less favored by your competitor."
* There can be "Negative network effects", e.g. in dating apps, when more same-gender users increase
  competition for the other users of that same gender.
* Friendster couldn't technically handle the demand, and they grew all regions at once, but
  throttled each region, which diluted their network effects. Facebook grew without throttling, but
  region by region.

## Feeling heard - value for employees (chap 10)

* "Services dominate advanced economies -- they contribute almost 80 percent of US GDP -- and both
  their cost and their value to customers are greatly influenced by the engagement of employees."
* "Increased compensation lowers the firm's margins. There is no value creation, only
  redistribution. By contrast, more attractive working conditions *create more value* by reducing
  WTS, the lowest compensation that a person is willing to accept for the work."
* "Uber made work safer for its drivers by recording the identity of passengers and allowing drivers
  to rate their customers. As a result, Uber has almost twice as many female drivers as regular taxi
  companies in the United States."
* The company can attract workers who particularly value the ways in which it has developed its
  employee experience. E.g. training, childcare.
* "The opportunity to exchange money for time is increasingly popular, particularly in developed
  economies and among younger employees."
* Work experience benefits can be more targeted and thus better ROI for the company than cash. Cash
  is an indiscriminate benefit -- everyone likes cash.
  * "Cash yields less powerful selection effects."
* "To be competitive in the market for talent, companies need to 'match' competing offers. But
  matching does not imply paying the same compensation ('paying market'). Matching means creating as
  much value for your employees."
* "Companies create more attractive working conditions to lower WTS. They then share this value by
  reducing compensation. As long as th drop in WTS is greater than the reduction in salaries, both
  employees and companies are better off."
* Lowering wages after improving WTS is hard, for two reasons:
  * 1) power - the company is easily seen as abusing its bargaining power over employees, even if in
    reality they did something to lower the employees' WTS.
  * 2) experience: on the way in, you can't willingly accept lower wages without first experiencing
    the company and its employee experience.
  * "Compensation below market is immediate and certain. More attractive working conditions,
    however, are felt over time and are difficult to asset when you are deciding whether to take
    that new job."
  * (So then... how does one actually translate improvements in work experience to achieve a lower
    WTS among the workforce? Maybe employee experience ultimately improves WTS by improving employee
    retention, rather than lowering cash compensation.)
* "Making work more attractive need not be rocket science. Consult any of your staff engagement
  surveys. Like Quest, you will find that employees have many ideas to make their work more
  pleasant. Pursue the ones that also raise productivity."

## Gigs and passions (chap 11)

* Flexibility in location or working hours creates value and improves WTS by allowing the worker to
  choose to do work when it's most convenient for them.
* A common barrier to implementing flextime in a company is if it stigmatizes the employee as being
  "not serious" or "not dedicated." To combat this, reward output, and have some senior leaders
  leverage flextime.
* "Linking people's passions to your business purpose is an exciting avenue for value creation. This
  works best if the projects and activities are intrinsically interesting and require a limited time
  commitment."

## Supply chains are people too (chap 12)

* "How do you actually lower the WTS of your suppliers? By making it more cost effective to sell to
  your organization. Any initiative that makes life easier for your suppliers, any investment on
  your part that makes them more productive, will lower their WTS and create more value."
* Nike trained its many suppliers in lean production, so they could be more productive and could
  sell to Nike for less.

## When big is beautiful (chap 13)

* Productivity usually increases with scale due to economies of scale. Fixed costs amortized across
  a greater revenue base.
* "Minimum efficient scale": minimum size at which average costs plateau with quantity. Below this
  scale, bigger firms have a cost advantage. At this scale, each firm is roughly on equal footing.

## Learning (chap 14)

* An organization progresses along a learning curve, making the process used for producing the
  product, and employee familiarity with that process, increasingly efficient. This lowers costs.
* "Learning effects are most powerful if they reduce cost at an intermediate pace. If costs decline
  very fast or very slowly, there is little advantage in having produced more than your
  competitors."
* "Be aware of the dark side of learning. Because you benefit from running the same process many
  times, learning can lock in your organization and stifle innovation."
  * The product, and how to make it, become coupled.

## No reason to sneer (chap 15)

* Is operational excellence sufficient to create differences from competitors?
* The author argues that empirically, yes, it is. Saying "it's all about strategy" is too simple.
  Competitors are slow to discover and move to new techniques, and in iterating, the firms will find
  its own ways to raise WTP.
  * (This is in contrast to Hamilton Helmer's Seven Powers, which puts more weight on strategic
    advantage, saying that operational excellence is not a durable differentiating strategy. Maybe
    they agree, but are referencing different timescales here).

## Being Bad in the Service of Good (chap 17)

* "Just as much as our job is to build something genuinely useful, something which really does make
  people's working lives simpler, more pleasant and more productive, our job is also to understand
  what people think they want and then translate the value of Slack into their terms." - Stewart
  Butterfield.
* On the "hero executive" that can do everything: "the danger is to take this model of personal
  success and apply it to organizations. (Some) people can be good at almost everything, but
  companies cannot. Firms must pick and choose where they strive for excellence lest they be
  condemned to remaining second-rate."
  * Partly because firms are composed of regular people, and are not full of alpha execs.

## Guiding investment (chap 18)

* (Kind of interesting in this chapter to see a few tools used in strategy consulting, but it felt
  like an MBA smorgasbord).
* Generally, try to deepen an area of differentiation rather than catch up on some other area, so
  you remain differentiated and aren't forced to compete merely on price.

## Connecting the dots (chap 19)

* Summarizing a case study of Tommy Hilfiger producing a line of clothing for people with
  disabilities: this line had increased WTP and reduced WTS because everyone wanted to pitch in, and
  saw purpose in helping this customer group.
