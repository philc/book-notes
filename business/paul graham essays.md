  * "[Hackers] use their office as a place to think. And if you're a technology company, their
    thoughts are your product. So making hackers work in a noisy, distracting environment is like
    having a paint factory where the air is full of soot." (Great Hackers)
  * "I just got an iPod, and it's not just nice. It's *surprisingly* nice. For it to surprise me, it
    must be satisfying expectations I didn't know I had. No focus group is going to discover those.
    Only a great designer can."
  * The theory of genius vs. hard work
    * "I'm not saying that there's no such thing as genius. But if you're trying to choose between
      two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right."
  * Stay upwind: choose things that interest you and open up more future choices. It's hard to say
    in advance which career one should aim for, because most of the best careers aren't even
    available yet. They're on the frontier of civilization.
  * "The word 'aptitude' is misleading, because it implies something innate. The most powerful sort
    of aptitude is a consuming interest in some question, and such interests are often acquired
    tastes."
  * "Your life doesn't have to be shaped by admissions officers. It could be shaped by your own
    curiosity. It is for all ambitious adults. ANd you don't have to wait to start."
  * "How do you figure out what customers want? Watch them."
    * Watch them work, watch them use your early software.
  * "To make something users love, you have to understand them. And the bigger you are, the harder
    that is. So I say 'get big slow.' The slower you burn through your funding, the more time you
    have to learn."
  * "I may be an extremist, but I think hiring people is the worst thing a company can do."
  * "There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the rudder of great work. It
    will not only drive you, but if you let it have its way, will also show you what to work on."
  * "The opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the opinion of a much larger group
    you might or might not respect, just adds noise."
  * "Important work" needs big chunks of time and the right mood, so he argues when you get both,
    it's worth pausing other responsibilities for a time, even if it causes you more pain.
    * "If you get inspired by some project, it can be a net win to blow off everything you were
      supposed to do for the next few days to work on it. Yes, those errands may cost you more time
      when you finally get around to them."
  * "In theory it's good when the founders finally get enough money to hire people to do some of the
    work for them. But it may be better to be oveerworked than interrupted. Once you dilute a
    startup with ordinary office workers -- with type-B procrastinators -- the whole company starts
    to resonate at their frequency. They're interrupt-driven, and soon you are too."
  * Working on important problems, as Hamming prescribed:
    * "But you have to adjust the angle just right: you have to be facing the big problem directly
      enough that you catch some of the excitement radiating from it, but not so much that it
      paralyzes you."
  * "As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive pleasure. You have to
    like what you do enough that the concept of 'spare time' seems mistaken."
  * "Prestige is especially dangerous to the ambitious. If you want to make ambitious people waste
    their time on errands, the way to do it is to bait the hook with prestige. That's the recipe for
    getting people to give talks, write forewords, serve on committees, be department heads, and so
    on. It might be a good rule simply to avoid any prestigious task."
  * "You have to be determined, but flexible, like a running back."
  * "The eminent generally respond to the shortage of time by turning into managers. They don't have
    time to work. They're surrounded by junior people they're supposed to help or supervise. The
    obvious solution is to have the junior people do the work. Some good stuff happens this way, but
    there are problems it doesn't work so well for: the kind where it helps to have everything in
    one head."
  * "When you have multiple founders, esprit de corps binds them together in a way that seems to
    violate conservation laws. Each thinks 'I can't let my friends down.' This is one of the most
    powerful forces in human nature."
  * "The stick-to-your-vision approach works for something like winning an Olympic gold medal,
    where the problem is well-defined. Startups are more like science, where you need to follow
    the trail wherever it leads."
  * "In almost everything, reward is proportionate to risk. So by protecting their kids from risk,
    parents are, without realizing it, also protecting them from rewards. If they saw that, they'd
    want you to take more risks."
  * "The weakest point in big companies is that they don't let individual programmers do great work.
    So if you're a little startup, this is the place to attack them. Take on the kind of problems
    that have to be solved in one big brain."
  * "Colleges differ, but they're nothing like the stamp of destiny so many imagine them to be.
    People aren't what some admissions officer decides about them at seventeen. They're what they
    make themselves."
    * "What matters is what you make of yourself. I think that's what we should tell kids. Their job
      isn't to get good grades so they can get into a good college, but to learn and do."
  * "From what we've seen, being good seems to help startups in three ways: it improves their
    morale, it makes other people want to help them, and above all, it helps them be decisive."
  * "When founders seem unfocused, I sometimes suggest they try to get customers to pay them for
    something, in the hopes that this constraint will prod them into action."
  * "Having to hit a growth number every week forces founders to act, and acting veruss not acting
    is the high bit of succeeding."
* Succinctness is power (May 2002)
  * Which language is the best to think in? "Ultimately, I think you have to go with your gut. What
    does i feel like to program in the language? I think the way to find (or design) the best
    language is to become hypersensitive to how well a language lets you think, then choose/design
    the language that feels best."
  * People value different things. PG requires macros -- languages without that feel clumsy to him.
  * "I think it's the same feeling you get when the street you want to take is blocked off, and you
    have to take a long detour to get where you wanted to go. THere is something you want to say,
    and the language won't let you."
* Great hackers (Jul 2004)
  * "Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun, and which they're delighted to find
    people will pay them for."
  * "If you make enough money, you get to work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackers
    *are* attracted by the idea of making really large amounts of money."
    * Great hackers care about interesting work more than money, but money allows them to do
      interesting work.
  * You can pay a 10x programmer 2-3x the average salary and they'll be happy, because money is not
    the main thing they want. And most hiring managers don't really believe in 10x programmers, or
    at least, can't reliably identify them.
  * Like all craftsmen, good hackers find it unbearable to use bad tools.
  * "Business types prefer the most popular languages because they view languages as standards."
  * "Good hackers insist on [technical] control" -- of their platform and dependencies. So they use
    OSS.
  * "They use their office as a place to think. And if you're a technology company, their thoughts
    are your product. So making hackers work in a noisy, distracting environment is like having a
    paint factory where the air is full of soot."
  * To understand a good work environment for hackers, see their setup at home, where they have full
    control over the environment.
  * "When they work at home, hackers don't work in noisy, open spaces; they work in rooms with
    doors. They work in cozy, neighborhoody places with people around and somewhere to walk when they
    need to mull something over, instead of in glass boxes set in acres of parking lots. They have a
    sofa they can take a nap on when they feel tired, instead of sitting in a coma at their desk,
    pretending to work. There's no crew of people with vacuum cleaners that roars through every
    evening during the prime hacking hours."
  * Any problem can be interesting if it has novel technical challenges. Managers can add value by
    being avid users of the product, or avid critics of the system, and extracting high standards,
    as Jobs did.
  * Nasty little problems
    * These are not interesting. E.g. writing UI for buggy software.
    * "The distinguishing feature of nasty little problems is that you don't learn anything from
      them."
    * "Some problems inherently have this character. And because of supply and demand, they pay
      especially well."
  * Startups are powerful because good founder hackers are motivated to work on nasty
    customer-specific problems because it's their startup. Cf the schlep blindness essay.
  * Clumping: good hackers attract other good hackers. Like a strong graduate department.
  * "VCs are mistaken to look for the next Microsoft, because no startup can be the next Microsoft
    unless some other company is prepare to bend over at just the right moment and be the next IBM."
  * "If it is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do it may be to make the
    following deal with yourself: you never have to work on boring projects (unless your family will
    starve otherwise), and in return, you'll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job."
* The Python Paradox (Aug 2004)
  * "When you program, you spend more time reading code than writing it. You push blobs of course
    code around the way a sculptor does blobs of clay. So a language that makes source code ugly is
    maddening to an exacting programmer, as clay full of lumps would e to a sculptor."
  * "Real ugliness is not harsh-looking syntax, but having to build programs out of the wrong
    concepts. Perl may look like a cartoon character swearing, but these are cases where it
    surpasses Python conceptually."
  * (Ruby was taking off around this time, for its pleasant syntax).
* The age of the essay (Sept 2004)
  * Gems
    * "An essay doesn't begin with a statement, but with a question. In a real essay, you don't take a
      position and defend it. You notice a door that's ajar, and you open it and walk in to see what's
      inside."
    * "Don't write the essay readers expect; one learns nothing from what one expects."
  * "Due to a series of historical accidents the teaching of writing has gotten mixed together with
    the study of literature."
    * As so kids practice writing by analyzing symbolism in Literature.
  * (Interesting argument / history about howe we came upon the habit of analyzing modern literature
    and how it got bundled with writing instruction)
  * Late 1800s: professors were expected to do research, not just teach.
    * "Colleges had long taught English composition. But how do you do research on composition? The
      professors who taught math coul be required to do original math, the professors who taught
      history could be required to write scholarly articles about history, but what about the
      professors who taught rhetoric or composition? What should they do research on? The closest
      thing seemed to be English literature."
  * Taking a position and defending it is what we're taught, but this is not the best way to find
    truth.
    * "Defending a position may be a necessary evil in a legal dispute, but it's not the best way to
      get at the truth, as I think lawyers would be the first to admit. It's not just that you miss
      subtleties this way. The real problem is that you can't change the question."
  * Students learning to write conclusions in arguments
    * "And the conclusion -- uh, what is the conclusion? I was never sure about that in high school.
      It seemed as if we were just supposed to restate what we said in the first paragraph, but in
      different enough words that no one could tell." (Yes, great; perhaps the same as "legal
      concluding remarks")
  * "When I give a draft of an essay to friends, there are two things I want to know: which parts
    bore them, and which seem unconvincing."
    * If it's boring, fix by cutting.
    * Unconvincing? Fix by saying more clearly, or altering the content.
    * "The aim is never to be convincing per se. As the reader gets smarter, convincing and true
      become identical, so if I can convince smart readers I must be near the truth."
  * "An essay is something you write to try and figure something out."
    * Essayer is French for "to try".
  * "An essay doesn't begin with a statement, but with a question. In a real essay, you don't take a
    position and defend it. You notice a door that's ajar, and you open it and walk in to see what's
    inside."
  * "In a real essay you're writing for yourself. You're thinking out loud."
    * But readership is valuable. "Just as inviting people over forces you to clean up your
      apartment, writing something that other people will read forces you to think well. So it does
      matter to have an audience."
  * "History seems to me so important that it's misleading to treat it as a mere field of study.
    Another way to describe it is *all the data we have so far*."
  * "Studying history gives one confidence that there are good ideas waiting to be discovered right
    under our noses."
  * "If there's one piece of advice I would give about writing essays, it would be: don't do as
    you're told. Don't believe what you're supposed to. Don't write the essay readers expect; one
    learns nothing from what one expects."
* What the bubble got right (Spe 2004)
  * "Going public early will not be the right plan for every company. And it can of course be
    disruptive -- by distracting the management, or by making the early employees suddenly rich."
    * (The only way to avoid crippling distraction, I think, is to have everyone there be for the
      mission. As it for the teams at Pixar and Microsoft.)
  * "I found that when I was at Yahoo, I couldn't help thinking, 'how will this sound to investors?'
    when I should have been thinking 'is this a good idea?'"
    * Options-based compensation is effective and fair, but incentivizes slightly the wrong
      behavior: to increase short-term market cap.
  * "Silicon Valley may not be the next Paris or London, but it is at least the next Chicago. For
    the next fifty years, that's where new wealth will come from."
    * "It's where the future is being built." It's full of people with aptitude.
  * "I think it's a big mistake for companies to loosen their belts as revenues increase. The
    question is not whether you can afford the extra slaries. Can you afford the loss in
    productivity that comes from making the company bigger?"
    * (How big could you grow revenues with a company of ~10, outsourcing everything except R&D?)
* Made in USA (Nov 2004)
  * Physical goods vs. software.
    * "With physical products there are more constraints. You don't win by dramatic innovations so
      much as by good taste and attention to detail."
  * His thesis of why we make ugly cities and cars.
    * "We don't especially prize design or craftsmanship here. What we like is speed, and we're
      willing to do something in an ugly way to get it done fast. In some fields, like software or
      movies, this is a net win."
    * Software and movies are malleable mediums, by contrast, where it's favorable to build quickly.
  * "I just got an iPod, and it's not just nice. It's *surprisingly* nice. For it to surprise me, it
    must be satisfying expectations I didn't know I had. No focus group is going to discover those.
    Only a great designer can."
* What you'll wish you'd known (in high school) (Jan 2005)
  * On the question "what do you want to do with your life"
    * "Adults ask this mainly as a conversation starter. They want to know aht sort of person you
      are, and this question is just to get you talking. They ask it the way you might poke a hermit
      crab in a tide pool, to see what it does." (so good)
  * The theory of genius vs. hard work
    * "I'm not saying that there's no such thing as genius. But if you're trying to choose between
      two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy, the other one is probably right."
  * Stay upwind: choose things that interest you and open up more future choices. It's hard to say
    in advance which career one should aim for, because most of the best careers aren't even
    available yet. They're on the frontier of civilization.
  * Working in a clump of smart people on hard problems is a symptom of being upwind. A problem is
    hard if there's suspense that you will fail.
  * Kids should not see their identity as "high school students. That's a day job, because most
    schools do not offer enriching, challenging problems to pursue; there's no way to get done
    anything important, or follow your curiosity.
  * "The word 'aptitude' is misleading, because it implies something innate. The most powerful sort
    of aptitude is a consuming interest in some question, and such interests are often acquired
    tastes."
  * "Curiosity turns work into play."
  * "It can take years to zero in on a productive question, because it can take years to figure out
    what a subject is really about."
  * "Your life doesn't have to be shaped by admissions officers. It could be shaped by your own
    curiosity. It is for all ambitious adults. ANd you don't have to wait to start."
  * "This may sound like bullshit. I'm just a minor, you may think, I have no money, I have to live
    at home, I have to do what adults tell me all day long. Well, most adults labor under
    restrictions just as cumbersome, and they manage to get things done. If you think it'
    restrictive being a kid, imagine having kids."
* How to start a startup (Mar 2005)
  * Outline:
    * Start with good people
    * Make something people want
    * Spend little money
  * "It's hard, but possible."
  * "The rulers of technology business tend to come from technology, not business. So if you want to
    invest two years in something that will help you succeed in business, the evidence suggests
    you'd do better to learn how to hack than get an MBA."
  * Validate what customers want by rapidly prototyping. Pick a tech stack which allows for this.
  * "How do you figure out what customers want? Watch them."
    * Watch them work, watch them use your early software.
  * What founders want from software is the kind of product that typically becomes open-source,
    unfortunately.
    * "You can use this as a way to generate ideas for startups: what od people who are not like you
      want from technology?"
  * "If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things you could do is find a
    middle-sized non-technology company and spend a couple weeks just watching what they do with
    computers."
  * Start by solving for and selling to smaller companies. Go for the "simple, inexpensive" option.
    * "They're the most strategically valuable part of the market anyway. In technology, the low end
      always eats the high end. It's easier to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to
      make a powerful product cheaper."
  * It sounds like PG loved doing customer support:
    * "Imagine talking to a customer support person who not only knew everything about the product,,
      but would apologize abjectly if there was a bug,, and then fix it immediately, while you were
      on the phone with them. Customers loved us. And we loved them."
  * "To make something users love, you have to understand them. And the bigger you are, the harder
    that is. So I say 'get big slow.' The slower you burn through your funding, the more time you
    have to learn."
  * "This was slightly embarrassing at the time, but in retrospect the grad-studenty atmosphere of
    our office was another of those things we did right without knowing it." (Having a cheap, hacker
    culture).
  * "Besides being cheaper and better to work in, apartments tend to be in better locations than
    office buildings."
  * "I may be an extremist, but I think hiring people is the worst thing a company can do."
    * Running expense; requires more rel estate; slows collaboration.
* A unified theory of VC suckage (Mar 2005)
  * VCs are funds, and charge AUM feeds. This encourages funds to be large.
  * "Like steroids, these sudden huge investments can do more harm than good."
  * "Google survived enormous VC funding because it could legitimately absorb large amounts of
    money. They had to buy a lot of servers and a lot of bandwidth to crawl the whole Web. Less
    fortunate startups just end up hiring armies of people to sit around having meetings."
* Undergraduation (Mar 2005)
  * Joining a smart tribe in college by working for a professor:
    * "Professors are especially interested in people who can solve tedious system-administration
      type problems for them, so that is a way to get a foot in the door. What they fear are flakes
      and resume padders. It's all too common for an assistant to result in a net increase in work.
      So you have to make it clear you'll mean a net decrease."
  * "If you want to start your own company, which I think will be more and more common, master the
    most powerful tools you can find, because you're going to be in a race against your competitors,
    and they'll be your horse."
  * "There's a fundamental problem in 'computer science,' and it surfaces in situations like this.
    No one is sure what 'research' is supposed to be. A lot of research is hacking that had to be
    crammed into the form of an academic paper to yield one more quantum of publication."
* Why smart people have bad ideas (Apr 2005)
  * Every founder must pass through the phase of trying to execute a bad business idea so they can
    develop the sense of what a good, viable business idea is.
  * "Where there's muck, there's brass. Meaning that unpleasant work pays."
  * 'As it turns out, VC-backed startups are not that fearsome. They're too busy trying to spend
    all that money to get software written."
  * Thinks YC applicants are good at solving problems but poor at picking good problems, because
    school and society trains them to focus narrowly on solving pre-defined problems.
  * "That's the essence of a startup: having brilliant people do work that's beneath them. Big
    companies try to hire the right person for the job. Startups win because they don't -- because
    they take people so smart that they would in a big company be doing 'research,' and set them
    work instead on problems of the most immediate and mundane sort. Think Einstein designing
    refrigerators."
* Hiring is obsolete (May 2005)
  * The market is more discerning of the value that can be produced by a capable person, even if
    they're young and inexperienced.
    * "The market is a lot more discerning than any employer. And it is completely
      non-discriminatory. On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog. And more to the point, nobody
      knows you're 22. All users care about is whether your site or software gives them what they
      want."
  * "The central problem in big companies, and the main reason they're so much less productive
    than small companies, is the difficulty of valuing each person's work. Buying larval startups
    solves that problem for them: the acquirer doesn't pay till the developers have proven
    themselves. Acquirers are protected on the downside, but still get most of the upside."
  * "Big companies are good at extracting the value from existing products, but bad at creating
    new ones."
    * "They can't do product development."
  * "The more general version of this problem is that there are too many new ideas for companies to
    explore them all. There might be 500 startups right now who think they're making something
    Microsoft might buy. Even Microsoft probably couldn't manage 500 development projects in-house."
  * "Big companies also don't pay people the right way. People developoing a new product in a big
    company get paid roughly the same whether it succeeds or fails. People at a startup expect to
    get rich if the product succeeds, and get nothing if it fails. So naturally the people at the
    startup work a lot harder."
  * "The mere bigness of big companies is an obstacle. In startups, developers are often forced to
    talk directly to users, whether they want to or not, because there is no one else to do sales
    and support."
* What business can learn from open source (Aug 2005)
  * "Amateurs": people who work for the love of it.
    * "People working for love often surpass those working for money."
    * (I thought professional vs. amateur was a comparison of skill and depth of training, not
      sponsorship...)
  * "Hackers tend to think business if for MBAs. But business administration is not what you're
    doing in a startup. What' you're doing is business *creation*. And the first phase of that is
    mostly product creation -- that is, hacking. That's the hard part. It's a lot harer to create
    something people love than to take something people love and figure out how to make money from
    it."
* After the ladder (Aug 2005)
  * "Economic statistics are misleading because they ignore the value of safe jobs. An easy job from
    which one can't be fired is worth money."
    * As is the case with jobs at bid companies.
  * "One of the main causes of the decay of the corporate ladder is the trend for takeovers that
    began in the 1980s. Why waste your time climbing a ladder that might disappear before you reach
    the top?"
  * "People had to deal with a lot more corporate politics, in order to protect the work they'd
    invested in a position on the ladder."
* Ideas for startups (Oct 2005)
  * http://www.paulgraham.com/ideas.html
  * (Helpful list of sources for ideas, which can be used to classify the types of ideas I'm having)
  * "The main value of your initial idea is that, in the process of discovering it's broken, you'll
    come up with your real idea."
  * "The initial idea is just a starting point -- not a blueprint, but a question. It might help if
    they were expressed that way. Instead of saying that your idea is to make a collaborative,
    web-based spreadsheet, say: could one make a collaborative, web-based spreadsheet?"
    * "An assertion provokes objections in a way a question doesn't."
  * The benefit of universities: "New technologies are the ingredients startup ideas are made of,
    and conversations with friends are the kitchen they're cooked in."
  * Why writing Java for a bank pays well:
    * "The market price for that kind of work is higher because it gives you fewer options for the
      future. A job that lets you work on exciting new stuff will tend to pay less, because part of
      the compensation is in the form of the new skills you'll learn."
  * Why a founder needs cofounders
    * "Even Einstein needed people to bounce ideas off. Ideas get developed in the process of
      explaining them to the right kind of person. You need that resistance, just as a carver needs
      the resistance of the wood."
  * Recommends a "together-alone-together" sandwich of collaborating on new ideas.
  * Make thing X dramatically cheaper or easier is fertile ground for valuable ideas.
    * "if you want to start a startup, you can take almost any existing technology produced by a big
      company, and assume you could build something way easier to use."
  * The Woz route: build-for-yourself is the most fun route to ideas.
  * "It seems like it violates some kind of conservation law, but there it is: the best way to get
    a 'million dollar idea' is just to do what hackers enjoy doing anyway."
* How to fund a startup (Nov 2005)
  * (A long HOWTO for startups about sources of capital, and terms).
  * Funding your company with consulting revenue:
    * "Risk and reward are usually proportionate, however: you should expect a plan that cuts the risk
      of starting a startup also to cut the average return. In this case, you trade decreased
      financial risk for increased risk that your company won't succeed as a startup."
    * Since consulting is safe, it removes the social fear of failure as a powerful motivator.
    * "Consulting is where product companies go to die. IBM is the most famous example. So starting
      as a consulting company is like starting out in the grave and trying to work your way up into
      the world of the living."
  * On syndicates: "the more prominent the angel, the less likely they are to belong to a group."
  * "The key to closing deals is never to stop pursuing alternatives."
* Good and bad procrastination (Dec 2005)
  * "The most impressive people I know are all procrastinators. They're type-C procrastinators: they
    put off working on small stuff to work on big stuff."
  * "Important work" needs big chunks of time and the right mood, so he argues when you get both,
    it's worth pausing other responsibilities for a time, even if it causes you more pain.
    * "If you get inspired by some project, it can be a net win to blow off everything you were
      supposed to do for the next few days to work on it. Yes, those errands may cost you more time
      when you finally get around to them."
  * "In theory it's good when the founders finally get enough money to hire people to do some of the
    work for them. But it may be better to be oveerworked than interrupted. Once you dilute a
    startup with ordinary office workers -- with type-B procrastinators -- the whole company starts
    to resonate at their frequency. They're interrupt-driven, and soon you are too."
  * Hamming: "What's the best thing you could be working on, and why aren't you?"
    * Work done on big problems has no immediate reward. There may not be many validating
      intermediate milestones, so it's demoralizing.
    * "But you have to adjust the angle just right: you have to be facing the big problem directly
      enough that you catch some of the excitement radiating from it, but not so much that it
      paralyzes you."
  * "I think the way to 'solve' the problem of procrastination is to let delight pull you instead of
    making a to-do list push you. Work on an ambitious project you really enjoy, and sail as close
    to the wind as you can, and you'll leave the right things undone."
* How to do what you love (Jan 2006)
  * As a kid, work is most commonly defined as "not play."
    * (For jobs which are truly fun, we should use a different word... for some adults, it's
      actually their preferred way to play, but kids would never know this about us).
  * "Maybe it would be better for kids in this one case if parents were not so unselfish. A parent
    who set an example of loving their work might help their kids more than an expensive house."
  * "As a lower bound, you have to like your work more than any unproductive pleasure. You have to
    like what you do enough that the concept of 'spare time' seems mistaken."
    * (Fun way to put it).
  * "To be happy I think you have to be doing something you not only enjoy, but admire."
  * "Prestige is especially dangerous to the ambitious. If you want to make ambitious people waste
    their time on errands, the way to do it is to bait the hook with prestige. That's the recipe for
    getting people to give talks, write forewords, serve on committees, be department heads, and so
    on. It might be a good rule simply to avoid any prestigious task."
  * "The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do it even if they weren't paid
    for it -- even if they had to work at another job to make a living. How many corporate lawyers
    would do their current work if they had to do it for free, in their spare time, and take day
    jobs as waiters to support themselves?"
  * "All parents tend to be more conservative for their kids than they would for themselves, simply
    because, as parents, they share risks more than rewards. If your eight year old son decides to
    climb a tall tree, or your teenage daughter decides to date the local bad boy, you won't get a
    share in the excitement, but if your son falls, or your daughter gets pregnant, you'll have to
    deal with the consequences."
  * 'Always produce' is also a heuristic for finding the work you love. If you subject yourself to
    that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you're supposed to
    work on, toward things you actually like. 'Always produce' will discover your life's work the
    way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the hole in your roof."
  * A young person typically does not get enough information by the end of high school or college to
    know which profession they will actually enjoy.
* The hardest lessons for startups to learn (Apr 2006)
  * "Perhaps the most important reason to release early... is that it makes you work harder. When
    you're working on something that isn't released, problems are intriguing. In something that's
    out there, problems are alarming."
  * "No idea for a product could ever be so clever as the ones you can discover by smashing a beam
    of prototypes into a beam of users."
    * "You'll find more interesting things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just
      by thinking."
  * On the consequences of founder commitment to their startup:
    * "If you're determined to stick around, people will pay attention to you, because odds are
      they'll have to deal with you later. You're a local, not just a tourist, so everyone has to
      come to terms with you."
  * "You have to be the right kind of determined, though. I carefully chose the word determined
    rather than stubborn, because stubbornness is a disastrous quality in a startup. You have to be
    determined, but flexible, like a running back."
  * On the natural optimism of founders: "I think the place to draw the line is between what you
    expect of yourself, and what you expect of other people. It's ok to be optimistic about what you
    can do, but assume the worst about machines and other people."
* How to Be Silicon Valley (May 2006)
  * You need young nerds (founders) and rich people (investors). (a( world-class university, and a
    town with personality, are required such that students want to stay there after graduating, and
    rich people are happy moving there.
  * (Good but brief remarks about how many specific large U.S. cities don't satisfy these criteria).
* The power of the marginal (Jun 2006)
  * "One way to tell whether a field has consistent standards is the overlap between the leading
    practitioners and the people who teach the subject in universities."
    * Some fields have lower overlap between teachers and the top practitioners. This is why
      majoring in business in undergrad is not a good idea -- you will not be learning from the best
      practitioners.
    * (Although for undergrad isn't it more important that the professor is a good teacher rater
      than a good practitioner?)
  * "The eminent... are weighed down by their eminence. Eminence is like a suit: it impresses the
    wrong people, and it constrains the wearer."
  * "The eminent generally respond to the shortage of time by turning into managers. They don't have
    time to work. They're surrounded by junior people they're supposed to help or supervise. The
    obvious solution is to have the junior people do the work. Some good stuff happens this way, but
    there are problems it doesn't work so well for: the kind where it helps to have everything in
    one head."
  * "So if you want to beat those eminent enough to delegate, one way to do it is to take advantage
    of direct contact with the medium." (i.e. write your own code).
  * Try to do the whole, large problem in one head. Woz wrote both Apple II's hardware and software.
  * "Delegation is endemic in business."
    * "Instead of avoiding it as a drawback of senility, many companies embrace it as a sign of
      maturity."
    * "Though this feels stressful, it's one reason startups win. The needs of customers and the
      means of satisfying them are in one head."
  * "Outsiders are not merely free but compelled to make things that are cheap and lightweight. And
    both are good bets for growth: cheap things spread faster, and lightweight things evolve
    faster."
    * "Small things can be done fast. The prospect of seeing the finished project hangs in the air
      like the smell of dinner cooking."
  * Responsibility is "an occupational disease of eminence": the eminent accrue obligations which
    consume their days.
  * On writing essays for a wide, public audience: "In principle you could have written them and
    just shown them to your friends; in practice that didn't work. An essayist needs th resistance
    of the audience, just as an engraver needs the resistance of the plate."
    * "Without the prospect of publication, the closest most people come to writing essays is to
      write in a journal. I find I never get as deeply into subjects as I do in proper essays. As
      the name implies, you don't go back and rewrite journal entries over and over for two weeks."
* Copy what you like (Jul 2006)
  * Copy what you like, rather than what's admired by people, or what you find virtuous.
  * "What kind of book do you read and feel sad that there's only half of it left, instead of being
    impressed that you're half way through? That's what you really like."
* A student's guide to startups (Oct 2006)
  * (Fun essay on the advantages and disadvantages of students and young founders vs. older
    founders)
  * People should wait to start a startup until after college graduation, because while still a
    student, the pain of failure is low -- you can easily save face by retiring your summer project
    and returning to school. Post-graduation, your identity converts from student to founder, and
    you become all-in.
  * "There are a lot of people out there working on boring stuff who are desperately in need of
    better software, so however short you think you fall of Larry and Sergey, you can ratchet down
    the coolness of the idea far enough to compensate."
  * In a startup, "the very implementation is different. Its main purpose is to refine the idea.
    Often the only value of most of the stuff you build in the first six months is that it proves
    your initial idea was mistaken. And that's extremely valuable. If you're free of a misconception
    that everyone else still shares, you're in a powerful position."
  * Unlike in a class project, in a startup, implementation is the least of your problems.
    Iterating to a good problem to solve, via encounters with users, is the main problem worth of
    your time.
  * "There may be business school classes on entrepreneurship, as they call it over there, but these
    are likely to be a waste of time. Business schools like to talk about startups, but
    philosophically they're at the opposite end of the spectrum."
* The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups (Oct 2006)
  * Single founder
    * "It's a vote of no-confidence."
    * "Starting a startup is too hard for one person. Even if you could do all the work yourself,
      you need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you out of stupid decisions, and to cheer you
      up when things go wrong."
    * "When you have multiple founders, esprit de corps binds them together in a way that seems to
      violate conservation laws. Each thinks 'I can't let my friends down.' This is one of the most
      powerful forces in human nature."
  * Marginal niche
    * Depersonalizing idea generation: "I think this shrinking from big problems is mostly
      unconscious. It's not that people think of grand ideas but decide to pursue smaller ones
      because they seem safer. Your unconscious won't even let you think of grand ideas. So the
      solution may be to think about ideas without involving yourself. What would be a great idea
      for *someone else* to do as a startup?"
  * Obstinacy
    * "The stick-to-your-vision approach works for something like winning an Olympic gold medal,
      where the problem is well-defined. Startups are more like science, where you need to follow
      the trail wherever it leads."
  * Hiring bad programmers
    * On good programmers vs. bad (colorful image)
      * "Then they're mystified to find that their startup lumbers along like a World War II bomber
        while their competitors scream past like jet fighters."
  * Having no specific user in mind
    * If you're not the target user, then you must be empirical when designing; one must "fly using
      the instruments" rather than your own gut. This is much slower and harder.
  * Raising too much money
    * "When you raise a lot of money, your company moves to the suburbs and has kids."
    * "The more people you have, the more you stay pointed in the same direction."
      * E.g. if you have an existing sales team, it's harder to pivot to a different kind of GTM
        motion.
* How Art Can Be Good (Dec 2006)
  * "Being good art is thus a property of objects as much as, say, being toxic to humans is: it's
    good art if it consistently affects humans in a certain way."
    * Beauty is not merely a subjective view in the eye of the beholder. It's an objective property
      of the object, if you take beauty to mean "affects humans in a certain way."
  * "This is not to say, of course, that good paintings must have faces in them, just that
    everyone's visual piano has that key on it."
* Is It Worth Being Wise? (Feb 2007)
  * On the difference between wisdom and intelligence:
    * "A wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart person knows what to do in
      situations where few others could."
    * Wisdom
  * When we say wisdom, we mean knowing what to do in a lot of situations -- having a high average
    outcome. Intelligence is being able to achieve something extraordinary in a few situations.
  * Advising someone, or editing another's work, is very different in nature from inventing.
    * "Someone like a judge or a military officer can in much of his work be guided by duty, but
      duty is not guide in making things. Makers depend on something more precarious: inspiration.
      And like most people who lead a precarious existence, they tend to be worried, not contended."
  * "Another sign we may have to choose between intelligence and wisdom is how different their
    recipes are. Wisdom seems to come largely from curing childish qualities, and intelligence
    largely from cultivating them."
  * "Cultivating intelligence seems to be a matter of identifying some bias in one's character --
    some tendency to be interested in certain types of things -- and nurturing it. Instead of
    obliterating  your idiosyncrasies in an effort to make yourself a neutral vessel for the truth,
    you select one and try to grow it from a seedling into a tree."
    * Developing intelligence is like developing a muscle.
    * Whereas cultivating wisdom is historically about stripping away one's own bias and mental
      debris. (But if wisdom comes from experience, couldn't wisdom also be cultivated by diligent
      examination of each experience, trying to generalize it?)
  * "The wise are all much alike in their wisdom, but very smart people tend to be smart in
    distinctive ways."
  * "The path to wisdom is through discipline, and the path to intelligence through carefully
    selected self-indulgence."
* Why to Not Not Start a Startup (Mar 2007)
  * Reasons not to start a startup, and commentary on which are valid.
  * "I've come close to starting new startups a couple times, but I always pull back because I don't
    want four years of my life to be consumed by random schleps. I know this business well enough to
    know you can't do it half-heartedly. What makes a good startup founder so dangerous is his
    willingness to endure infinite schleps."
  * On working for a big software company after college:
    * "At first it may seem cool to get paid for doing easy stuff, after paying to do hard stuff in
      college. But that wears off after a few months. Eventually it gets demoralizing to work on
      dumb stuff, even if it's easy and you get paid a lot."
  * "In almost everything, reward is proportionate to risk. So by protecting their kids from risk,
    parents are, without realizing it, also protecting them from rewards. If they saw that, they'd
    want you to take more risks."
* The Hacker's Guide to Investors (Apr 2007)
  * Most VCs are not like founders. The job of a VC -- listening to pitches, sitting on boards -- is
    probably not fun for a founder.
    * "Hackers like to make things. This would be like being an administrator."
  * Most VCs are looking for big hits. Angels are OK with smaller hits because it's their
    money, and because they don't need to do as few deals as a VC, because they don't take board
    seats.
  * VCs are afraid of looking bad, because their LPs have some concrete ideas about which kind of
    deasl and decisions are prudent.
  * "Being turned down by VCs doesn't mean much. Lots of VCs rejected Google."
  * Among VCs, "the spirit of cooperation is stronger than the spirit of competition. The reason,
    again, is that there are so many deals. Though a professional investor may have a closer
    relationship with a founder he invests in than with other investors, his relationship with the
    founder is only going to last a couple years, whereas his relationship with other firms will
    last his whole career."
    * They also all want the investor class to retain power. So you will most likely not have VCs
      directly bidding against each other for your deal.
  * "Here's a test for deciding whether a VC's response was yes or no. Look down at your hands. Are
    you holding a term sheet?"
    * VCs want to select investments based on social proof, so will say "no" in a way which leaves
      the door open if they change their minds.
  * Be a cockroach: "Instead of a beautiful but fragile flower that needs to ahve its stem in a
    plastic tube to support itself, better to be small, ugly, and indestructable."
* Stuff (Jul 2007)
  * A cluttered room is depressing
    * "I think humans constantly scan their environment to build a mental model of what's around
      them. And the harder a scene is to parse, the less energy you have left for conscious
      thoughts. A cluttered room is literally exhausting."
  * "Except for books, I now actively avoid stuff. If I want to spend money on some kind of treat,
    I'll take services over goods."
  * "A historical change has taken place, and I've now realized it. Stuff used to be valuable, and
    now it's not."
    * Most every day possessions that people actually need and use are more easily available and
      affordable than they used to be. The rest is being pushed by ecommerce companies using
      effective tactics.
    * "In industrialized countries the same thing happened with food in the middle of teh twentieth
      century."
* Holding a program in one's head (chap 10)
  * "The danger of a distraction depends not on how long it is, but on how much it scrambles your
    brain."
  * "You can magnify the effect of a powerful language by using a style called bottom-up
    programming, where you write programs in multiple layers, the lower ones acting as programming
    languages for those above. If you do this right, you only have to keep the topmost layer in your
    head." (interesting)
  * "You yourself are the most important reader. Especially in the beginning; a prototype is a
    conversation with yourself."
  * "Don't have multiple people editing the same piece of code. You never understand other people's
    code as well as your own. No matter how thoroughly you've read it, you've only read t, not
    written it. So if a piece of code is written by multiple authors, none of them understand it as
    well as a single author would."
  * "You can't safely redesign something other people are weorking on. It's not just that you'd have
    to ask permission. You don't even let yourself think off such things. Redesigning code with
    several authors is like changing laws."
  * Organizations by definition don't want to depend on individual genius.
  * "The weakest point in big companies is that they don't let individual programmers do great work.
    So if you're a little startup, this is the place to attack them. Take on the kind of problems
    that have to be solved in one big brain."
* How not to die (Aug 2007)
  * (Nice essay. In short: don't hedge your bets by working on other things beside your startup
    (e.g. grad school, consulting), make sure failures will be public and painful, and don't give
    up).
  * "The low points in a startup are just unbelievably low. I bet even Google had moments where
    things seemed hopeless. Knowing that should help."
  * It's easy to feel like "what we're doing isn't working" if no one cares about what you've made.
    To mitigate that risk, at least try to make something that some handful of people care about.
    Then you will have validation, and a default course: incrementally expand that core group.
  * "I'll tell you now: bad shit is coming. It always is in a startup. The odds of getting from
    launch to liquidity without some kind of disaster happening are one in a thousand. So don't get
    demoralized." Expect painful periods so they don't feel so surprising and painful when they
    come.
* News from the front (Sep 2007)
  * In short: the university one has attended means very little as a predictor of that person's
    capability, likelihood to succeed at a startup, or their self-worth.
  * Why would we think college admissions for the top schools are particularly accurate assessments
    of intelligence and capability?
    * "When you think about what it means to have gone to an elite college, how could this be true?
      We're talking about a decision made by admissions officers -- basically, HR people -- based on
      a cursory examination of a huge pile of depressingly similar applications submitted by
      seventeen year olds. And what do they have to go on? An easily gamed standardized test; as
      short essay telling you what the kid thinks you want to hear; an interview with a random alum;
      a high school record that's largely an index of obedience. Who would rely on such a test?"
    * (Well put)
    * (I think the advantage of being part of a top college is being part of a biased sample of the
      students who applied there. The average at a top college should be better than other colleges.
      That doesn't mean that every, or even most, students will be capable.)
  * Companies buying enterprise software: the person buying wants a safe, explainable decision. This
    same rationale is present in company hiring decisions based on the college of the applicant.
    * "They just want to buy from a supplier who seems safe -- a company with an established name,
      confident salesmen, impressive offices, and software that conforms to all the current
      fashions."
  * Versus founding a startup:
    * "All users care about is whether you make something they like. If you don't, you're dead."
    * Unlike joining a big company, the "test" of founding a startup taht makes useful software is
      not gameable. It's pure.
      * (Probably athletic performance is a similarly pure test).
  * "What we've found is that the variation between schools is so much smaller than the variation
    between individuals that it's negligible by comparison. We can learn more about someone in the
    first minute of talking to them than by knowing where they went to school."
  * Any college can produce high-quality learning because the professors at most colleges are smart,
    and there are pockets of smart peers to learn from at every reasonable school -- one just has
    to work to find and connect with them.
  * "Colleges differ, but they're nothing like the stamp of destiny so many imagine them to be.
    People aren't what some admissions officer decides about them at seventeen. They're what they
    make themselves."
  * "Indeed, the great advantage of not caring where people went to college is not just that you can
    stop judging them (and yourself) by superficial measures, but that you can focus instead on what
    really matters. What matters is what you make of yourself. I think that's what we should tell
    kids. Their job isn't to get good grades so they can get into a good college, but to learn and
    do. And not just because that's more rewarding than worldly success. That will increasingly *be*
    the route to worldly success."
* The future of web startups (Oct 2007)
  * "Starting a startup is hard, but having a 9 to 5 job is hard too, and in some ways a worse kind
    of hard. In a startup you have lots of worries, but you don't have that feeling that your life
    is flying by like you do in a big company."
  * "We often tell startups to release a minimal version one quickly, then let the needs of the
    users determine what to do next. In essence, let the market design the product."
  * Founders are more conservative than investors because they have all of their eggs in one basket.
    "If startups are easy to start, this conflict goes away, because founders can start them
    younger, when it's rational to take more risk, and can start more startups total in their
    careers. When founders can do lots of startups, they can start to look at the world in the same
    portfolio-optimizing way as investors."
    * (I'm not sure this captures the whole story. Another variable is one's identity. It's wrapped
      up in professional success. It's painful for potential founders to defer that until a later
      age.)
  * "The amount of selling required in an industry is always inversely proportional to the judgement
    of the buyers."
    * Example: VC is difficult to raise because VCs are not skilled judges of what is good.
    * Showing them a launched product which already has traction is a form of selling that's better
      suited to hackers.
  * "In a world of startups, elite universities will play less of a role as gatekeepers... the way
    this problem ultimately gets solved may not be by reforming the universities but by going around
    them. We in the technology world are used to that sort of solution: you don't beat the
    incumbents; you redefine the problem to make them irrelevant."
  * Anecdote from a recently acquired founder: his team was 1/13th as productive after the
    acquisition, as measured by LOC.
* You weren't meant to have a boss (Mar 2008)
  * Lion analogy: how a lion feels in the wild vs. the zoo. Be a lion in the wild.
  * There's a natural size of group for humans to work with. Subdividing corporations into smaller
    units puts pressure on the management layer, which is where the group attaches to the tree.
  * (I guess if the groups in a large company never had to work together -- each was part of a
    holding company -- this would be fine. The difficulty is when a whole company has to be highly
    coordinated.)
  * "So working in a group of 10 people within a large organization feels both right and wrong at
    the same time. On the surface it feels like the kind of group you're meant to work in, but
    something major is missing."
    * People are missing autonomy and individual initiative -- the kind they would manifest if they
      were on their own or part of a true small tribe.
  * Companies slow down because of the tree structure inherent in organizing large groups. "There is
    one thing companies can do short of structuring themselves as sponges: they can stay small. If
    I'm right, then it really pays to keep a company as small as it can be at every stage."
* Why there aren't more Googles (Apr 2008)
  * "Corporate M&A is a strange business in that respect. They consistently lose the best deals,
    because turning down reasonable offers is the most reliable test you could invent for whether a
    startup will make it big."
  * "Howard Aiken said 'Don't worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good,
    you'll have to ram them down people's throats.'"
  * Argues that VCs are surprisingly conservative and most won't fund bold ideas. But it's the bold
    ideas that create monster companies.
* Be good (Apr 2008)
  * "From what we've seen, being good seems to help startups in three ways: it improves their
    morale, it makes other people want to help them, and above all, it helps them be decisive."
  * The "tamagotchi effect" of having users:
    * "If you feel you're really helping people, you'll keep working even when it seems like your
      startup is doomed. Most of us have some amount of natural benevolence. The mere fact that
      someone needs you makes you want to help them. So if you start the kind of startup where users
      come back each day, you've basically built yourself a giant tamagotchi. You've made something
      you need to take care of."
  * "The best hackers tend to be idealistic", so having a benevolent mission will make it more
    likely that they'll join you.
  * "Startups are faced with so many choices about what to do." How to handle this?
    * "Here's the answer: do whatever's best for your users. You can hold onto this like a rope in a
      hurricane, and it will save you if anything can. Follow it and it will take you through
      everything you need to do."
  * And being good / telling the truth scales well. You can tell people things without ulterior
    motives, and you don't need to track what you've previously said.
    * "Being good is a particularly useful strategy for making decisions in complex situations
      because it's stateless. It's like telling the truth. The trouble with lying is that you have
      to remember everything you've said in the past to make sure you don't contradict yourself. If
      you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything, and that's a really useful property in
      domains where things happen fast."
* Cities and ambition (May 2008)
  * "A city speaks to you mostly by accident -- in things you see through windows, in conversations
    you overhear. It's not something you have to seek out, but something you can't turn off."
  * "The conversations you overhear tell you what sort of people you're among."
    * You want "high-quality eaves dropping."
  * "Because ambitions are to some extend incompatible and admiration is a zero-sum game, each city
    tends to focus on one type of ambition."
  * "Someone starting a startup in New York would feel like a second class citizen. There's already
    something else people in New York admire more."
  * Some cities send no message to its inhabitants. The great cities all send a message about what
    type of ambition is most valued there.
    * NYC: money
    * Cambridge: ideas and intelligence
    * Silicon Valley: power, impact.
    * Berkeley, SF: live better.
    * LA: fame, physical beauty.
    * DC: in crowd.
  * The changing definition of economic power: "The Captains of Industry of times past had
    laboratories full of clever people cooking up new technologies for them. The new breed are
    themselves those people."
  * Does one have to live in a great city to do great work?
    * "It's in fields like the arts or writing or technology that the larger environment matters. In
      these the best practitioners aren't conveniently collected in a few top university departments
      and research labs -- partly because talent is harder to judge, and partly because people pay
      for these things, so one doesn't need to rely on teaching or research funding to support
      oneself. It's in these more chaotic fields that it helps most to be in a great city: you need
      the encouragement of feeling that people around you care about the kind of work you do, and
      since you have to find peers for yourself, you need the much larger intake mechanism of a
      great city."
  * Find the city where you feel most at home, where it sends the message that most resonates with
    you.
    * "Your best bet is probably to try living in several places when you're young. You can never
      tell what message a city sends till you live there, or even whether it still sends one. Often
      your information will be wrong."

* A fundraising survival guide (Aug 2008)
  * Have low expectations: the disappointment from the process, and the outcome, being lower than
    one's expectations, will kill morale.
  * With deals, "become pathologically cynical."
    * "Deals do not have a trajectory like most other human interactions, where shared plans
      solidify linearly over time. Deals often fall through at the last moment. Often the other
      party doesn't really think about what they want till the last moment."
  * "If you keep the company moving forward -- releasing new features, increasing traffic, doing
    deals, getting written about -- those investor meetings are more likely to be productive. Not
    just because your startup will seem more alive, but also because it will be better for your own
    morale, which is one of the main ways investors judge you."
  * "The custom of a startup needing a fixed amount of funding is an obsolete one left over from the
    days when startups were more expensive."
    * So leave the round size unbound.
    * E.g. "The route we take will depend on how much we raise."
  * Be ramen profitable, for morale and leverage
    * "Once you cross into ramen profitable, everything changes. You may still need investment to
      make it big, but you don't need it this month."
  * "At Viaweb we were forced to operate like a consulting company initially, because we were so
    desperate for users that we'd offer to build merchants' sites for them if they'd sign up."
    * Consulting can have the advantage that you're immersed with some users, and you can service
      their needs using your evolving product.
* Why to start a startup in a bad economy (Oct 2008)
  * "The truth is... boring: the state of the economy doesn't matter much either way."
  * "Startups often make things cheaper, so in that respsect they're better positioned to prosper in
    a recession than big companies."
  * "Another advantage of bad times is that there's less competition. Technology trains leave the
    station at regular intervals. If everyone else is cowering in a corner, you may have a whole car
    to yourself."
* The other half of "artists ship" (Nov 2008)
  * "It's natural for organizations to learn from mistakes. The problem is, people who propose new
    checks almonst never conisder that the check itself has a cost."
  * "At big companies, software has to go through various approvals before it can be launched. And
    the cost of doing this can be enormous -- in fact, discontinuous."
    * Meaning, it gets so annoying to release something that the SWE quits and leaves for a startup.
* After credentials (Dec 2008)
  * "Cram schools turn wealth in one generation into credentials in the next."
    * Cram schools defeat the intention of tests of performance to filter for actual ability.
  * "History suggetss that, all other things being equal, a society prospers in proportion to its
    ability to prevent parents from influencing their children's success directly."
  * "The problem comes when parents use direct methods: when they are able to use their own wealth
    or power as a substitute for their children's qualities."
    * Indirect methods are things which improve ability to succeed, e.g. actually trying to raise
      their kids well.
  * "Sealing off this force [of direct parental help] has a double advantage. Not only does a
    society get 'the best man for the job,' but parents' ambitions are diverted from direct methods
    to indirect ones --to actually trying to raise their kids well."
  * Credentials are helpful for predicting performance in lieu of actual data about performance. The
    author argues that data about an individuals' performance is hard to get in a large
    organization, so those organizations must rely on credentials more than smaller orgs.
* Startups in 13 sentences (Feb 2009)
  * "The reason to launch fast is not so much that it's critical to get your product to market
    early, but that you haven't really started working on it till you've launched. Launching teaches
    you what you should have been building. Till you know that you're wasting your time. So the
    main value of whatever you launch with is a pretext for engaging users."
  * "It's a big mistake to treat a startup as if it were merely a matter of implementing some
    brilliant initial idea. As in an essay, most of the ideas appear in the implementing."
  * "Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent"
    * "It's easier to expand userwise than satisfactionwise."
  * "In the earliest stages of a startup, it pays to offer customer service on a level that wouldn't
    scale, because it's a way of learning about your users."
* How to be an angel investor (Mar 2009)
  * "Don't spend much time worrying about the details of deal terms, especially when you first start
    angel investing. That's not how you win at this game. When you hear people talking about a
    successful angel investor, they're not saying 'He got a 4x liquidation preference.' They're
    saying 'He invested in Google.'"
  * "There is a surprising lack of correlation between how hot a deal a startup is and how well it
    ends up doing. Lots of hot startups will end up failing, and lots of startups no one likes will
    end up suceeding. And the latter are so despearate for money that they'll take it from anyone at
    a low valuation."
  * "VCs can be fast followers. Most of them don't try to predict what will win. They just try to
    notice quickly when something already is winning. But angels have to be able to predict."
  * "If you can recognize good startup founders by empathizing with them -- if you both resonate at
    the same frequency -- then you may already be a better startup picker than the median
    professional VC."
  * "What makes a good founder/ If there were a word that meant the opposite of hapless, that would
    be the one. Ba founders seem hapless. They may be smart, or not, but somehow events overwhelm
    them and they get discouraged and give up. Good founders make things happen the way they want."
    * They have a healthy respect for reality, and also are relentlessly resourceful.
  * "Only good people can ride the thermals if they hit them anyway."
    * You can't predict thermals, so don't bother trying. Back good founders; they have a high
      chance of finding their way to a good market.
  * "There's a hack for being decisive when you're inexperienced: ratchet down the size of your
    investment till it's an amount you wouldn't care too much about losing."
* Relentlessly resourceful (Mar 2009)
  * "The best-short description of what makes for a good startup founder."
  * Running back metaphor: "A good running back is not merely determined, but flexible as well. They
    want to get downfield, but they adapt their plans on the fly."
  * "In any interesting domain, the difficulties will be novel. Which means you can't simply plow
    through them, because you don't know initially how hard they are; you don't know whether you're
    about to plow through a block of foam or granite. So you have to be resourceful. You have to
    keep trying new things."
  * A hiring test for potential cofounders, founding employees, and founders you want to invest in:
    "are they relentlessly resourceful?"
  * "If I were running a startup, this would be the phrase I'd tape to the mirror. 'Make something
    people want' is the destination, but 'Be relentlessly resourceful' is how you get there."
* Maker's schedule, manager's schedule (Jul 2009)
  * (Very helpful for communicating workstyle preferences to managers)
* Ramen profitable (Jul 2009)
  * "Ramen profitable means a startup makes just enough to pay the founders' living expenses." It
    buys you time.
  * It does not mean the company has succeeded on a big bet, as is the case with traditional
    notions of profitability.
  * "When people start to pay you significant amounts, the company starts to feel real. And your own
    living expenses are the milestone you feel most, because at that point the future flips state.
    Now survival is the default, instead of dying." Default alive.
  * "What keeps people from starting startups is the fear of having so much responsibility. And this
    is not an irrational fear: it really is hard to bear. ANything that takes some of that weight
    off you will greatly increase your chances of surviving."
  * "When founders seem unfocused, I sometimes suggest they try to get customers to pay them for
    something, in the hopes that this constraint will prod them into action."
  * A startup has to be a product company to scale, so ramen profitability should come from
    monetizing the product in some way, rather than from consulting.
* The list of N things (Sep 2009)
  * "Structurally, the list of n things is a degenerate case of essay. An essay can go anywhere the
    writer wants. In a list of n things the writer agrees to constrain himself to a collection of
    points of roughly equal importance, and he tells the reader explicitly what they are."
  * Writing a list of n things is easy; relaxing: "It's like the sort of programming where you write
    a version 1 very quickly and then gradually modify it, but at every point have working code --
    or the style of painting where you begin with a complete but very blurry sketch done in an hour,
    then spend a week cranking up the resolution."
  * "The greatest weakness of the list of n things is that there's so little room for new thought.
    The main point of essay writing, when done right, is the new ideas you have while doing it. A
    real essay, as the name implies, is dynamic: you don't know what you're going to write when you
    start. It will be about whatever you discover in the course of writing it."
* Persuade xor Discover (Sep 2009)
  * "I'd rather offend people than pander to them, and if you write about controversial topics you
    have to choose one or the other."
  * "Most writers write to persuade, if only out of habit or politeness. But I don't write to
    persuade; I wrote to figure out. I write to persuade a hypothetical perfectly unbiased reader."
  * "You don't know what the ideas are until you get them down to the fewest words."
  * "Would it be so bad to add a few extra words to make people feel better?" "The danger... is not
    merely that it's longer. It's that you start to lie to yourself. The ideas start to get mixed
    together with the spin you've added to get them past the readers' misconceptions."
  * "Writing to persuade and writing to discover are diametrically opposed."
  * "I worry that if I wrote to persuade, I'd start to shy away unconsciously from ideas I knew
    would be hard to sell."
* What startups are really like (Oct 2009)
  * "What people wished they'd paid more attention to when choosing cofounders was character and
    commitment, not ability."
    * "You haven't seen someone's true colors until you've worked with them on a startup."
  * "I would rather cofound a startup with a friend than a stranger with higher output. Startups are
    so hard and emotional that the bonds and emotional and social support that come with friendship
    outweigh the extra output lost."
  * "I've been surprised again and again by just how much more important persistence is than raw
    intelligence."
  * "Product devvelopment is a conversation with the user that doesn't really start till you
    launch."
  * "It's so important to launch fast that it may be better to think of your initial version not as
    a product, but as a trick for getting users to start talking to you."
  * "The surprise is generally positive as well as negative. They won't like what you've built, but
    there will be other things they would like that would be trivially easy to implement. It's not
    till you start the conversation by launching the wrong thing that they can express Or perhaps
    even realize) what they're looking for."
  * "To benefit from engaging with users you have to be willing to change your idea."
  * "Hype doesn't make satisfied users, at least not for something as complicated as technology."
    Ignore competition; orient towards users and customers.
  * Forking: "The bets way for a startup to engage with slow-moving organizations is to fork off
    separate processes to deal with them. It's when they're on the critical path that they will kyou
    -- when you depend on closing a deal to move forward. It's worth taking extreme measures to
    avoid that."
  * "The question to ask about what you've built is not whether it's good, but whether it's good
    enough to supply the activation energy required."
* How to lose time and money (Jul 2010)
  * For both time and money, beware of "fake work."
  * "I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work. Dealing with email, for example. You
    do it sitting at a desk. It's not fun. So it must be work."
  * "The most dangerous traps now are new behaviors that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by
    mimicking more virtuous types."
  * Investing doesn't set off our mental alarms in the same way that indulging in luxury goods does.
    * "You're not spending the money; you're just moving it from one asset to another. Which is why
      people trying to sell you expensive things say 'it's an investment.'"
* The top idea in your mind (Jul 2010)
  * http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html
  * Great. In short: protect against what you let consume your mind, so that your background
    processing bandwidth isn't squandered.
  * "It's hard to do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower."
  * "I think most people have one top idea in their mind at any given time. That's the idea their
    thoughts will drift toward when they're allowed to drift freely."
    * All others will get starved out of background processing. So it's a disaster to let an
      unimportant idea become your top one.
  * "Once you start raising money, raising money becomes the top idea in your mind. That becomes
    what you think about when you take a shower in the morning." Progress on other areas grinds to a
    halt.
  * "Be careful what you let become critical to you. Try to get yourself into situations where the
    most urgent problems are ones you want to think about."
  * Disputes: "they have the same velcro-like shape as genuinely interesting ideas, but without the
    substance. So avoid disputes if you want to get real work done."
  * Some thoughts are like the Nile Perch: they push out more interesting ideas. Thoughts about
    money and disputes are both like this.
    * "Corollary: avoid becoming an administrator, or your job will consist of dealing with money
      and disputes."
  * "This doesn't deserve space in my head"
    * Turning the other cheek turns out to have selfish advantages. Someone who does you an injury
      hurts you twice: first by the injury itself, and second by taking up your time afterward
      thinking about it."
    * (PG talks about squandering time, but there's also great emotional benefit which comes from
      expunging an emotionally draining top idea from your mind, like a conflict.)
* What happened to Yahoo (Aug 2010)
  * (Fun essay about his observations from joining there in 1998).
  * "In technology, once you have bad programmers, you're doomed. I can't think of an instance where
    a company has sunk into technical mediocrity and recovered. Good programmers want to work with
    other good programmers. So once the quality of programmers ast your company starts to drop, you
    enter a death spiral from which there is no recovery."
  * "The company felt prematurely old."
  * "In the software business, you can't afford not to have a hacker-centric culture."
    * Yahoo wanted to be a media company, not a tech company run by programmers, because they
      latched on to a business model of scaling brand ads.

* Schlep blindness (Jan 2012)
  * http://www.paulgraham.com/schlep.html
  * Schlep: tedious, unpleasant task.
  * "A company is defined by the schleps it will undertake."
  * "The most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps is that much of it is unconscious. Your
    unconscious won't even let you see ideas that involve painful schleps. That's schlep blindness."
  * On ideas which require high levels of challenge, schlep: "that scariness makes ambitious ideas doubly
    valuable. In addition to their intrinsic value, they're like undervalued stocks in the sense that there's
    less demand for them among founders. If you pick an ambitious idea, you'll have less competition, because
    everyone else will have been frightened off by the challenges involved."
  * Example: why did so many startups try to build recipe sites or local event aggregators, instead of fixing
    payments, like Stripe did?

* Frighteningly ambitious startup ideas (Mar 2012)
  * "I think the way to use these bi ideas is not to try to identify a precise point in the future
    and then ask yourself how to get from here to there, like the popular image of a visionary."
  * "Don't try to construct the future like a building, because your current blueprint is almost
    certainly mistaken. Start with something you know works, and when you expand, expand westward."
  * "The popular image of the visionary is someone with a clear view of the future, but empirically
    it may be better to have a blurry one."

* Writing and speaking (Mar 2012)
  * "I don't wish I were a better speaker like I wish I were a better writer. What I really want is
    to have good ideas, and that's a much bigger part of being a good writer than being a good
    speaker."
  * Thinking about the sentences and ideas makes the ideas better, and improves your mastery of
    them. But rehearsing the material for a smooth delivery doesn't make your ideas better.
    * "All the time you spend practicing a talk, you could instead spend making it better."
  * "Any given person is dumber as a member of an audience than as a reader. Just as s speaker ad
    libbing can only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to say it, a person
    hearing a talk can only spend as long thinking about sentence as it takes to hear it."
  * Talks are inferior to writing for sources of ideas. But they do give us a live impression o the
    speaker, and thus can be good tools for becoming energized and motivated.

* Startup = growth (Sep 2012)
  * Definition of a startup: "the only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with
    startups follows from growth."
  * "You have to know that growth is what you're after. The good news is, if you get growth,
    everything else tends to fall into place. Which means you can use growth like a compass to make
    almost every decision you face."
  * Why doesn't every new company aim to be a startup?
    * "The constraints that limit ordinary companies also protect them. That's the tradeoff. If you
      start a barbershop, you only have to compete with other local barbers. If you start a search
      engine you have to compete with the whole world."
  * "The most important thing that the constraints on a normal business protect it from is not
    competition, however, but the difficulty of coming up with new ideas."
  * "That geographic constraint also helps define your company. Bar + neighborhood is a sufficient
    idea for a small business."
  * "The space of ideas has been so thoroughly picked over that a startup generally has to work on
    something everyone else has overlooked."
  * "We usually advise startups to pick a growth rate that they think they can hit, and then just
    try to hit it every week."
    * (Casting this as an optimization problem must be clarifying and focusing for the YC batches).
    * "Focusing on hitting a growth rate reduces the otherwise bewildering multifarious problem of
      starting a startup to a single problem."
    * "They could end up on a local maximum. But in practice that never happens. Having to hit a
      growth number every week forces founders to act, and acting versus not acting is the high bit
      of succeeding."
    * "Plus the maxima in the space of startup ideas are not spiky and isolated. Most fairly good
      ideas are adjacent to even better ones."
  * "You'll generally do best to follow that constraint wherever it leads rather than being
    influenced by some initial vision, just as a scientist is better off following the truth
    wherever it leads."
* How to get startup ideas (Nov 2012)
  * (Motivating; in short: it can be done; start building and embrace schleps.)
  * To start, optimize for something a few people want really badly.
    * "When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now? Who wants this
      so much that they'll use it even when it's a crappy version one made by a two-person startup
      they've never heard of? If you can't answer that, the idea is probably bad."
  * No one can really tell if an idea will remain niche, or has a "fast path" to other versions of
    itself that will become mass market.
    * E.g. Facebook: Harvard -> all colleges -> all people.
  * "Live in the future, then build what's missing."
    * Aim to be an expert, or at least an expert user, in a field, ideally one that's rapidly
      changing.
    * Alternate: "Live in the future and build what seems interesting."
  * Organic ideas
    * "The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas it not "think up" but "notice."
      At YC we call ideas that grow naturally out of the founders' own experiences 'organic' startup
      ideas. The most successful startups almost all being this way."
  * "What you should be spending your time on in college is ratcheting yourself into the future.
    College is an incomparable opportunity to do that."
    * Rather than studying "entrepreneurship", which is the easier part of forming a startup, and
      best learned by doing.
  * Beware of research
    * Because it's so narrow. It's almost constrained from being generally useful for solving real
      problems.
    * "For some reason, the more a project has to count as research, the less likely it is to be
      something that could be turned into a startup."
  * Err on the side of doing things where you'll face competitors. Inexperienced founders usually
    give competitors more credit than they deserve."
  * Developers have a preference to not interact with the messy world.
    * "But this preference is so widespread that the space of convenient startup ideas has been
      stripped pretty clean. If you let your mind wander a few blocks down the street to the messy,
      tedious ideas, you'll find valuable ones just sitting there waiting to be implemented."
  * Inorganic method / "recipes"
    * Produces ideas on demand, but requires much more discipline, because most of these ideas are
      bad and need to be filtered out.
    * "Try asking yourself whether there's something unusual about you that makes your needs
      different from most other people's. You're probably not the only one. It's especially good if
      you're different ina  way people will increasingly be."
    * "One way to ensure you do a good job solving other people's problems is to make them your own.
      When Rajat Suri of E la Carte decided to write software for restaurants, he got a job as a
      waiter to learn how restaurants worked."
    * "When one company or industry replaces another, it usually comes in from the side. So don't
      look for a replacement for x; look for something that people will later say turned out to be a
      replacement for x. And be imaginative about the axis along which the replacement occurs."
  * "It doesn't work well simply to try to think of startup ideas. If you do that, you get bad ones
    that sound dangerously plausible. The best approach is more indirect: if you have the right sort
    of background, good startup ideas will seem obvious to you."
  * Paul Buchheit, how how selling something bad can help you disqualify the idea, while discovering
    a new one that's actually valuable:
    * "The best technique I've found for dealing with YC companies that have bad ideas is to tell
      them to go sell the product ASAP (before wasitng time building it). Not only do they learn
      that nobody wants what they are building, they very often come back with a real idea that they
      discovered in the process of trying to sell the bad idea."

* How to do great work (Jul 2023)
  * "There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the rudder of great work. It
    will not only drive you, but if you let it have its way, will also show you what to work on."
  * "Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could."
  * "Fields change as you learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very
    different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need ot give different types of
    work a chance to show you what they're like."
  * "A field should become *increasingly* interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn't,
    it's probably not for you."
  * "Arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in. You'll shy away from hard tasks if
    you know you might be interrupted."
  * "It's ok to lie to yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example. Lots of
    great things began with someone saying 'How hard could it be?'"
    * The optimism and self-confidence of youth helps overcome the activation energy required to
      start work on a project.
  * "It many projects a lot of the best work happen sin what was meant to be the final stage," so
    finish what you start.
  * "If you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good."
    * This is perhaps because ambition to be the best is qualitatively different than
      ambition to be good. So set yourself up for success by aiming for world class.
  * "Nerds have an advantage in doing great work: they expend little effort on seeming anything. In
    fact that's basically the definition of a nerd. Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that's
    exactly what you need in doing great work. It's not learned; it's preserved from childhood. So
    hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather than the one who sits back and offers
    sophisticated-sounding criticisms of them."
  * "Some of the very best work will seem like it took comparatively little effort, because it was
    in a sense already there. It didn't have to be built, just seen. It's a very good sign when it's
    hard to say whether you're creating something or discovering it."
    * The work appears simple, with mathematical elegance.
  * "When you're doing work that could be seen as either creation or discovery, err on the side of
    discovery. Try thinking of yourself as a mere conduit through which the ideas take their natural
    shape."
    * (I feel this way about some of my projects.)
  * "You're much more likely to have original ideas when you're working on something. Original ideas
    don't come from trying to have original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand
    something slightly too difficult."
  * "Ideas that are the right kind of crazy tend to be exciting; they're rich in implications;
    whereas ideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing." (fun)
  * "One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is the problem that people think has
    been fully explored, but hasn't."
    * "So if you're interested in a field that others think is tapped out, don't let their skepticism
      deter you. People are often wrong about this."
    * (This was the case when I started Liftoff in 2012. Every investor we spoke to said mobile
      performance marketing was "figured out" and we were too late.)
  * PG recommends to indulge yourself on what might seem to be interested, but unimportant,
    problems. People tend to be too conservative in their assessment of what might be important.
  * "People think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight was in the question."
  * Planning vs. "evolving prototypes"
    * "[planning] is a necessary evil -- a response to unforgiving conditions. It's something you
      have to do because you're working with inflexible media, or because you need to coordinate the
      efforts of a lot of people. If you keep projects small and use flexible media, you don't have
      to plan as much, and your designs can evolve instead."
  * On schools
    * On overcoming the passivity that's inherent in the design of modern schools
      * "If you're still in school, try thinking of your education as your project, and your teachers as
        working for you rather than vice versa."
      * "They'd prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a source of advice, rather than being
        pulled by them through the material."
    * Getting ahead in school by hacking the test does not help with your progress outside of
      school.
      * "You can't do great work by doing that. You can't trick God. So stop looking for that kind
        of shortcut."
  * Copying or including existing work does not make the work unoriginal.
    * "Originality is the presence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones."
  * "One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from one field into another."
  * Approaching people with a hobbyist's mindset
    * "Most people who are very good at something are happy to talk about it with anyone who's
      genuinely interested. If they're really good at their work, then they probably have a
      hobbyist's interest in it, and hobbyists always want to talk about their hobbies."
  * "The degree to which great work happens in clusters suggests that one's colleagues often make
    the difference between doing great work and not."
  * "Avoid intermediaries between you and your audience."
    * "The value of an audience doesn't grow anything like linearly with its size. Which is bad news
      if you're famous, but good news if you're just starting out, because it means a small but
      dedicated audience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of people genuinely love what
      you're doing, that's enough."
  * "Don't marry someone who doesn't understand that you need to work, or sees your work as
    competition for your attention. If you're ambitious, you need to work; it's almost like a
    medical condition so someone who won't let you work either doesn't understand you, or does and
    doesn't care."
  * "The opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the opinion of a much larger group
    you might or might not respect, just adds noise."
  * The whole process of doing great work is a "dance with curiosity"
    * "Notice how often that word [curiosity] has come up. If you asked an oracle the secret to
      doing great work and the oracle replied with a single word, my bet would be on 'curiosity.'"
  * "The discoveries are out there, waiting to be made. Why not by you?"
  * "One way to tell whether you're wasting time is to ask if you're producing or consuming. Writing
    computer games is less likely to be a waste of tiem than playing them, and playing games where
    you create something is less likely to be a waste of time than playing games where you don't."
* Superlinear returns (Oct 2023)
  * "If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many
    customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business."
  * Two causes of superlinear returns: exponential growth in the domain, and thresholds.
  * Startup traction tends to have exponential growth: existing customers and momentum makes it less
    effort to acquire the next customer.
  * "The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times was probably scholarship.
    The more you know, the easier it is to learn new things."
  * "Some of these thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read, you're able to
    learn anything else much faster."
  * "The most important thresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge seems to
    be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the boundary of one area of knowledge, you
    sometimes discover a whole new field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new
    discoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and Darwin."
  * Work can compound: doing well in an earlier turn improves how well you do in the next turn.
    * It compounds by teaching you (since learning compounds).
  * "The existence of a threshold doesn't guarantee the game will be worth playing."
  * "At the far end of the curve, incremental effort is a bargain."
    * (At the far end of the performance curve, where you can get superlinear returns).
  * "If there's a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure of time and energy, it will
    be increasingly valuable to do it when you're young and don't yet have children."
  * "'At this rate', you find yourself thinking, 'I'll never get anywhere.' But because the reward
    curve rises so steeply at the far end, it's worth taking extraordinary measures to get there. In
    the startup world, the name for this principle is 'do things that don't scale.' If you pay a
    ridiculous amount of attention to your tiny initial set of customers, ideally you'll kick off
    exponential growth by word of mouth."
  * "Even now to most people the phrase 'your work' means their job. But to a writer or artist or
    scientist it means wahtever they're currently studying or creating."
