* Intro
  * Carl Jung's stone "Tower" (his private home office: "There was no electricity at the Tower, so as day gave
    way to night, light came from oil lamps and heat from the fireplace. Jung would retire to bed by ten p.m..
    'The feeling of repose and renewal that I had in this tower was intense from the start.'"
  * Deep work definition: professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that
    push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and
    are hard to replicate.
  * Shallow work: non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted.These
    efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
  * Networking tools result in fragmented time for knowledge workers.
  * Learning a new skill or career is a form of deep work; like learning to code. Newport argues that many
    have lost this ability.
  * Deep work is valuable today because 1) the information economy changes quickly, and evolving requires
    learning deep things; 2) broad distribution of via the internet means it's easy for people to ignore
    mediocrity, and so you must differentiate your work.
  * Cal, on being present for his kids after work: the lack of distraction in my life tones down that
    background hum of nervous mental energy that seems to increasingly pervade people's daily lives.
* Deep work is valuable (chap 1)
  * To compete in this economy requires learning hard things quickly, and sustained elite performance, both of
    which are forms of deep work.
  * Deliberate practice requires two things: a narrow focus on improving a skill or idea, and a feedback loop
    so you can correct your approach and focus your attention on what's most productive.
  * Deliberate practice: "Let your mind become a lens, thanks to the converging rays of attention; let your
    soul be all intent on whatever it is that is established in your mind as a dominant, wholly absorbing
    idea."
  * High quality work produced = (time spent) x (intensity of focus)
  * Attention residue: "that quick email check introduces a new target for your attention. Even worse, seeing
    messages that you cannot deal with at the moment, you'll be forced to turn back to the primary task with a
    secondary task left unfinished."
  * Why is Jack Dorsey successful? His work cannot be deep.
    * "A good chief executive is essentially a hard-to-automate decision engine. They have built up a hard-won
      repository of experience and have honed and proved an instinct for their market. They're then presented
      inputs throughout the day -- int he form of emails, meetings -- that they must process and act on.
    * Not all jobs require depth to be successful. Some sales and customer success jobs reward connectedness
      and responsiveness more.
* Deep work is rare (chap 2)
  * Open offices might create more opportunities for collaboration, but they do so at the cost of "massive
    distraction".
  * He argues that few companies seem to prioritize deep work. Communication and coordination is more
    valued, at the expense of deep work. Maybe at a certain scale, that's the right tradeoff. Eliminating
    duplicate work is more valuable than deep work.
  * The "metric black hole"
    * Some behaviors are very hard to measure in terms of impact and cost to the company. If it were easy,
      they would be quantified and eliminated. Email, meetings, impromptu distractions, open floor plans.
  * The principle of least resistance
    * without good metrics for some behaviors, this is why they prevail.
    * In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of behaviors to the bottom line, we will
      tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment.
    * Why we prefer our team mates to be highly available: "if you couldn't count on this quick response
      time you'd instead have to do more advance planning for your work, be more organized, and be prepared
      to put things aside for a while and turn your attention elsewhere while waiting for what you
      requested."
    * Reactive work is better defined than proactive work. So it's easier in that way.
  * Standing meetings: for many, standing meetings become a simple (but blunt) form of personal
    organization. Instead of trying to manage their time and obligations themselves, they let the impending
    meeting each week force them to take some action on a given project and more generally provide a highly
    visible simulacrum of progress.
  * The Principle of Least Resistance, protected from scrutiny by the metric black hole, supports work
    cultures that save us from the short-term discomfort of concentration and planning, at the expense of
    long-term satisfaction and the production of real value.
  * Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity: many professions do not have a clear metric for measuring
    productivity, so workers call back to optimizing time spent and responsiveness / latency.
  * "Assuming the trends outlined here continue, depth will become increasingly rare and therefore
    increasingly valuable."
* Deep work is meaningful (chap 3)
  * He argues that doing deep work which restricts your focus to meaningful problems will give you joy, and
    prevent you from being distracted by noisy, shallow, less-meaningful everyday trivia.
    * "Our brains construct our worldview based on what we pay attention to. If you focus on a cancer
      diagnosis, you and your life become unhappy and dark, but if you focus instead on an evening martini,
      you and your life become more pleasant -- even through the circumstances in both scenarios are the
      same."
  * More "time on the hammock" is not actually the kind of time people would enjoy most. "Ironically, jobs are
    actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback
    rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one's work, to concentrate and
    lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to
    be shaped into something that can be enjoyed."
  *  Human begins are at their best when immersed deeply in something challenging.
  * Craftsmanship as a philosophical construct for getting meaning from our existence.
    * "The wheelwright doesn't decide arbitrarily which virtues of the wood he works are valuable and which
      are not: this value is inherent in the wood and the task it's meant to perform"
    * "A wooden wheel is not noble, but its shaping can be. The same applies to knowledge work. You don't need
      a rarified job; you need instead a rarified approach to your work." He argues that most knowledge work
      can be cast as craftsmanship, int hat you're applying high levels of skill.
* Work deeply (chap 4)
  * It costs willpower to switch to and then maintain focus on hard work, so use habits and rituals like a
    "deep work by default" time and environment, so it's more automatic to engage in deep work, and so you're
    less vulnerable to willpower fatigue and shiny distractions.
  * Knuth's "monastic philosophy" to deep work
    * "I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address. I'd used
      email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15 years of email is plenty for one lifetime. Email is a
      wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to
      be on the bottom of things. What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration.
    * His approach is a radical reduction of all non-core, shallow work. This only really applies if you are
      an individualized creator with a clear, narrow contribution, like an author or inventor.
  * Bimodal strategy of deep work scheduling: reserve deep work days, or monthly retreats, or entire seasons
    (like academics do in the summer). The rest of time is filled with operations.
  * Rhythmic strategy of deep work scheduling: some time every day, like before you go to work. More habitual
    and compatible with most environments, but less deep, since you'll get 2 hour chunks at most...
    * Chappell, a doctoral candidate with a full time job and child: "he made a rule that he would wake up
      and start working by 530am every morning. he would then work until 730am, make breakfast, and go to work
      already done with his dissertation obligations for the day. Pleased by early progress, he soon pushed
      his wake-up time to 445am to squeeze out even more morning depth.
  * "Great creative minds think like artists but work like accounts." - David Brooks.
  * How to ritualize deep work:
    * Predetermine where you'll work and for how long, so you can precommit. Like your office with a clean
      desk; or a spot reserved only for deep work, like the library.
    * Determine how you'll use your time
      * Have a pre-programmed agenda, or a metric you're trying to hit, like words per hour. And rules of
        conduct: no email, phone in do-not-disturb mode.
      * "Without this structure, you'll have to mentally litigate again and again what you should and should
        not be doing during these sessions and keep trying to assess whether you're working sufficiently hard.
        These are unnecessary drains on your willpower reserves.
