* A brief history of male friendships (chap 3)
  * Argues that 150 years ago and into antiquity, many well-documented male relationships were openly fervent,
    emotionally; today's reservedness is not some function of men in general.
  * Argues that the Victorian age, and increased homophobia, discouraged emotionally deep male friendships.
  * Shoulder-to-shoulder friendships
    * Facing outward (e.g. conversing while walking) is friendly but not intimate.
    * (Sounds awful, compared to our tender childhood friendships as boys).
  * Goals of good friendships:
    * Inclusiveness
    * Acceptance of vulnerability
    * Curiosity
    * Respect of difference
  * Peacetime friendship:
    * "where men have the opportunity to connect with each other in openherated ways and to demonstrate their
      loyalty in the course of everyday life."
    * Many have in their head a model of wartime friendship being the only model: crusading together,
      sacrificing. But the more common model is peacetime friendship.
  * Successful men seem to reduce emotionally intimate behaviors because it doesn't fit the stereotype of
    successful, strong behavior.
* The seasons of man's friendships (chap 4)
  * Long-time friendships from childhood
    * "I think of these old friendships as a loving memory trust. They bring me back to times when I was young
      and unknowing. They remind me about what's good about my "essential" self. We affirm for each other how
      we've all grown and cahnged, endured and overcome, even triumphed over the years. These friendships are
      faithful companions, even through periods of silence."
  * "Each person, no matter how old, needs to master specific, age-releated challenges in order to feel
    fulfilled. A man's close male friends can help him navigate these turning points in ways that profoundly
    affect his health and relationships."
  * Boys' friendships
    * They help each other learn about what is expected of them and are teased if they miss.
    * Argues that boys get less cuddling and nurturing than girls, adn this leads them to be more aggressive
      as kids.
    * "Our habit of reducing nurturance and affection in rearing young boys actually inhibits their
      development of emotional independence and the ability to control thier impulses."
  * Teen friendships
    * Before teen years, boys can have deep friendships, trust each other with secrets, and not be exploited
      for sharing vulnerability.
    * In teens, competition increases due to girls and puberty, creating distance.
  * Young adult friendships
    * "Many young men, in an effort to look confident, also struggl ewith how honest they can be with
      themselves and each other about their personal life challenges."
    * Young adults can use mentors at this stage in thier life but don't establish or aren't receptive to
      these relationships.
  * In 1:1 settings, emotional intelligence is higher. In group settings, "the important feelings often get
    left out or tamped down in this environment."
  * Middle age
    * 35-50 is the most challenging emotional stage: bonding with spouse, raising kids, making professional
      moves, all at the same time.
    * "Men often complain, with justification, that their old friendships don't feel emotionally responsive to
      the new wave of responsibility they are experiencing."
    * Men need guy friends more than ever in this phase and need to be intentional about it.
* At the starting gate (chap 5)
  * Your expectations about friendships
    * Friendships of utility are common among men, but is this what you want in your friends?
    * What you want: shared interests, someone who loyally has your back, someone who understands you.
  * Background and foreground nature of relationships
    * When friendships go dormant, "these relationships may rest quietly in the background for extended
      periods, needing time to stretch and breathe. But they can also reemerge in poignant, meaningful moments
      over the course of your lifetime. If you're like many men, you'll be glad you kept them."
* Conversations from the heart (chap 6)
  * "Conversations between men often consist of small talk, information trading, and problem solving, with the
    unspoken goal of keeping things light."
    * Too light; not enough depth for connection. Too much problem-solving.
    * Light guy talk is good for casual friendships and acquaintances, to help us feel seen and connected. But
      it's shallow.
  * Safety: one must never be perceived as disclosing personal information of your friends as gossip. This
    sends the signal that you're "not friend material."
  * Mutual sparring
    * Conveying respect: "the habit of routinely trading insults or solely making 'innocent' jokes at the
      other guy's expense with no added warmth or substances can get old and, frankly, annoying over time."
    * "While most will put up with it, they definitely will not open up when it's coming at them."
    * Mutual sparring is enjoyable in small doses
  * Active listening
    * Reflection: "a friend's ability to reflect back to us important things we've been saying. In short, a
      good friend presents you to you."
    * When mirroring back what they've heard, good listeners tend to helpfully simplify and clarify what has
      been said.
  * Share similar experiences: "the purpose here is not to give corrective advice but to support your friend
    emotionally in whatever he is experiencing. 'I get it' are three of the most powerful words in our
    language."
