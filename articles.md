* Elon Musk: Cooks vs. Chef (Nov 2015; read Aug 2019)
  * Must uses first principle thinking for everything
  * Framework: "what I want" X "what is real " => Goal Space => Strategies
  * Most people are cooks: following existing recipes, aka dogma.
  * Musk is a chef, who creates from scratch
  * To become a chef, realize that: you know nothing, others know nothing, and there's little to fear from
    trying ("grand theft life")
  * Lack of formal education is no reason not to do something. School is a slow method for downloading
    information. You can get information faster by reading
  * There's inherent creativity in 5 year olds. They ask the "why" questions to unearth the first principles.
    * Our education system strips this away and ultimately trains factory workers.
  * Cooks have more confidence in others than in themselves. If someone has published a best practice, by
    default, it's taken to be more authoritative and trustworthy than the cook's own framework. To be a chef,
    you must flip that default.
  * Start with humility: you don't know shit. Neither does anyone else. 99% of your knowledge and hypotheses
    are untested. Treat them with less certainty.
  * Assume you're wrong, and work towards being less wrong.

  * Look broader: Zoom out and get some perspective. Step back until you can see the fullness of something as big as the
    empire state building. Many times in problem solving, you're zoomed in on one piece of the puzzle and you
    take all inputs and constraints as given, and you try to optimize. But if you can zoom out and see which
    pieces of the system are contributing to the current problem, maybe you can change how those inputs work.
    It allows for more degrees of freedom in your solution, and deeper, more powerful solutions.
  * Look closer: zoom in on the details that matter, the details that other competitors just mail in about.
  * Think like a child. Have young minds on the team. Children do not preemptively answer their questions with
    "that's just how the world works."
