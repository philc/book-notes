* Elon Musk: Cooks vs. Chef (Nov 2015; read Aug 2019)
  * Must uses first principle thinking for everything
  * Framework: "what I want" X "what is real " => Goal Space => Strategies
  * Most people are cooks: following existing recipes, aka dogma.
  * Musk is a chef, who creates from scratch
  * To become a chef, realize that: you know nothing, others know nothing, and there's little to fear from
    trying ("grand theft life")
  * Lack of formal education is no reason not to do something. School is a slow method for downloading
    information. You can get information faster by reading
  * There's inherent creativity in 5 year olds. They ask the "why" questions to unearth the first principles.
    * Our education system strips this away and ultimately trains factory workers.
  * Cooks have more confidence in others than in themselves. If someone has published a best practice, by
    default, it's taken to be more authoritative and trustwrothy than the cook's own framework. To be a chef,
    you must flip that default.
  * Start with humility: you don't know shit. Neither does anyone else. 99% of your knowledge and hypotheses
    are untested. Treat them with less certainty.
  * Assume you're wrong, and work towards being less wrong.
