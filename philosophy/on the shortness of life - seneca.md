* Men's life comes to an end just as they are preparing to enjoy it."
* "We do not receive a short life, but we make it a short one, and we are not poor in days, but
  wasteful of them."
* Our lifespan is an ample portion if we arrange it with care. But usually we waste it through
  carelessness, or on luxury.
* "The time which has laid idle without any use having been made of it; you will see that you have
  not lived as many years as you count."
* "You spend it as though you had an abundant and overflowing store of it, though all the while that
  day which you devote to some man or to some thing is perhaps your last."
* Emperor Augustus, longing for retirement:
  * "He, who saw everything depending upon himself alone, who swayed the fortunes of men and of
    nations, thought that his happiest day would be that on which he laid aside his greatness."
  * "He knew by experience how much labour was involved in that glory that shone through all lands,
    and how much secret anxiety was concealed within it."
  * "The empire, like a body overloaded with blood, was always breaking out somewhere."
* "They live laboriously, in order that they may live better; they fit themselves out for life at
  the expense of life itself."
* "Postponement is the greatest waste of life: it wrings day after day from us, and takes away the
  present by promising something hereafter."
* "Buys people never notice that they are moving till they are at the end of
  [their life's journey]."
* (A critique of those who wallow in luxury and obsess over the details of their household and
  banquets, descending into vanity."
