* Preface
  * "The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action
    advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way." - Marcus Aurelius
* Intro
  * On the obstacle, or the unpleasant situation on the horizon: "What if embedded inside it or inherent in it
    were certain benefits -- benefits only for you?"
  * We're taught paths to success, but not how to overcome failure. Some can use obstacles as launch pads to
    success.
  * "Bad companies are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by
    them." - Andy Grove
  * "The Things which hurt, instruct." - Benjamin Franklin.
  * Summary of the method in the book: perception, action, will.
    * "It begins with how we look at our specific problems, our attitude or approach; then the energy and
      creativity with which we actively break them down and turn them into opportunities; finally, the
      cultivation and maintenance of an inner will that allows us to handle defeat and difficulty."
* The discipline of perception (chap 1)
  * Discard emotion, and what's left is truth; reality.
  * Be cool and ruthlessly objective.
  * Rockerfeller: making gains where others were fearful or greedy.
    * "the market was inherently unpredictable and often vicious -- only the rational and disciplined mind
      could hope to profit from it. Speculation led to disaster, he realized, and he needed to always ignore
      the 'mad crowd' and its inclinations."
    * "He was inclined to see the opportunity in every disaster."
  * "Everything that happens -- be it an economic crash or personal tragedy -- is a chance to move forward."
* Recognize your power (chap 2)
  * How you perceive situations is always your choice, and cannot be taken from you. As a result, we are never
    powerless.
  * Situations are neither good nor bad. Only our atittudes make them so.
  * On employee mistakes: "With a shift in perception, it can be exactly what you were looking for -- the
    chance to pierce through defenses and teach a lesson that can be learned only by experience. A *mistake*
    becomes *training*."
* Control your emotions (chap 4)
  * Uncertainty and fear are relieved by authority. Training is authority. It's a release valve.
    * Astronauts are trained to rely on their training, and keep emotions like fear and panic from affecting
      their actions.
    * The problems and stakes of space travel make our terrestirial high-stress situations, like speaking in
      front of a crowd, look inconsequential.
* Alter your perspective (Chap 6)
  * "The task, as Pericles showed, is not to ignore fear but to explain it away. Take what you're afraid of --
    when fear strikes you -- and break it apart."
* Is it up to you? (chap 7)
  * "Focusing exclusively on what is in our power magnifies and enhances our power."
    * Struggling against the unchanging rules of the game or lamenting past events is wasted effort.
* Live in the present moment (chap 8)
  * "in our own lives, we aren't content to deal with things as they happen. We have to dive endlessly into
    what everything 'means', whether something is 'fair' or not, what's 'behind' this or that, and what
    everyone else is doing. Then we wonder why we don't have the energy to actually deal with our problems."
  * Interesting argument: stop over-thinking the future. It comes at the cost of the present -- enjoying our
    current moments and being effective in them.
    * (At the end a day watching the kids, I should celebrate how present I've been. Sometimes instead I feel
      uneasy because I didn't advance some other unrelated goal I had in mind, apart from being a good parent
      by being present.)
  * "For all species other than us humans, things just are what they are. Our problem is that we're always
    trying to figure out what things *mean* -- why things are the way they are. As though they *why* matters.
    Emerson put it best: 'we cannot spend the day in explanation.' Don't waste time on false constructs."
  * "You can take the trouble you're dealing with and use it as an opportunity to focus on the present moment.
    To ignore the totality of your situation and learn to be content with what happens, as it happens. To have
    no 'way' that the future needs to be to confirm your predictions, because you didn't make any."
* Finding the opportunity (chap 10)
  * "The struggle against an obstacle inevitably propels the fighter to a new level of functioning. The extent
    of the struggle determines the extent of the growth. The obstacle is an advantage, not adversity."
    * Also: athletes who recover from serious injury.
* Practice persistence (chap 14)
  * Work on the obstacle from every angle repeatedly. Persistence is a good substitute for genius.
* Follow the process (chap 16)
  * University of Alabama football -- seek the process, not the championship.
    * Reminds me of the Bill Walsh 49ers "standards of performance."
  * The process: existing in the present, excelling at each step, focused on what you can do and can control.
  * "The process is relaxing." In this way, the hardest things become manageable.
    * "Break it down into pieces. Simply do what you need to do right now. And do it well. ANd then move on to
      the next thing. Follow the process and not the prize."
    * (Reminds me of "Do the next right thing" from Frozen 2).
  * "The process is about finishing the small task in front of you."
  * The nature of problems:
    * Every hard road is a system of connected composite parts that can be completed in sequence.
    * This knowlege will bring us comfort and confidence.
    * "We shy away from writing a book or making a film even though it's our dream because it's so much work
      -- we can't imagine how we get from here to there."
    * (Yes; true; preparing for and then starting a company is really a system of related tasks that are
      definable and achievable).
* What's right is what works (chap 18)
  * Radical pragmatist
    * "Still ambitious, aggressive, and rooted in ideals, but also imminently practical and guided by the
      possible."
  * "Under this kind of force, obstacles break apart. They have no choice. Since you're going around them or
    making them irrelevant, there is nothing for them to resist."
* Prepare for none of it to work (chap 24)
  * Using an obstacle or setback to practice one of our virtues, like forgiveness.
    * "Using it as an opportunity to practice some virtue or skill -- even if it is just learning to accept
      that bad things happen, or practicing humility."
* Love everything that happens: amor fati (chap 29)
  * "My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not
    forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it...
    but love it." - Nietzsche
  * "We've got to love what we do and all that it entails, good and bad. We have to learn to find joy in every
    single thing that happens."
  * "You love it because it's all fuel."
* Something bigger than yourself (chap 31)
  * Being the kind of person we believe others should be
    * "When we focus on others, on helping them or simply providing a good example, our own personal fears and
      troubles will diminish."
  * Pivoting one's perspective away from ourselves, towards others, is galvanizing: it immediately gives us
    something to do. A calling.
  * "Embrace this power, this sense of being part of a larger whole. It is an exhilarating thought. Let it
    envelop you. We're all just humans, doing the best we can. We're all just trying to survive, and in the
    process, inch the world forward a little bit."
* Meditate on your mortality (chap 32)
  * "It's a story as old as time. Man nearly dies, he takes stock, and emerges from the experience a
    completely different, and better, person."
  * "Death doesn't make life pointless, but rather purposeful. And, fortunately, we don't have to nearly die
    to tap into this energy."
    * It can be exhilirating and empowering, rather than morbid.
  * "The paths of glory leard but to the grave." - Thomas Gray
  * Why do we spend our time making more money than we could spend in a lifetime?
  * "They figure out what they need to do and do it, fitting in as much as possible before the clock expires.
    They figure out how, when the moment strikes, to say, 'Of course, I would have liked to last a little
    longer, but I made a lot out of what I was already given so this works too.'"
  * "In the shadow of death, prioritization is easier. As are graciousness and appreciation and principles."
    * "Why would you do the wrong thing? Why feel fear? Why let yourself and others down?"
  * "Death creates urgency, and urgency is invigorating."
