  * "Books on shelves and on tables are a kind of internal marketing exercise, reminding us who we
    are and who we want to be. We are physical beings so it perhaps makes sense for us to identify
    and express our values using physical objects, which we like to touch and smell as well as
    read."
* Intro
  * We categorize our history by the materials available to us -- stone age, copper, bronze, iron,
    silicon. Our mastery of materials shapes our society.
* Indomitable - steel (chap 1)
  * As you bend a paper clip, you are causing approximately 100,000,000,000,000 [crystal]
    dislocations to move at a speed of thousands of hundreds of meters per second."
    * Amazing -- the interaction of the micro scale with the human scale
  * Heating any metal soften sit.
    * "the melting point of a metal is an indicator of how tightly the metal atoms are stuck
      together and so also affects how easily the dislocations move."
  * Rock can only practically be carved with metal tools, so the discovery of smelting unlocked
    stone masonry and construction.
  * On alloys
    * "Alloys tend to be stronger than pure metals for one very simple reason: the alloy atoms have
      a different size and chemistry from the host metal's atoms, so when they sit inside the host
      crystal they cause all sorts of mechanical and electrical disturbances that add up to one
      crucial thing: they make it more difficult for dislocations to move. And if dislocations find
      it difficult to move, then the metal is stronger, since it's harder for the metal crystals to
      change shape. Alloy design is thus the art of preventing the movement of dislocations."
    * E.g. adding silver or copper to gold to make it much harder.
  * Steel is an iron + carbon alloy. Carbon came from the charcoal in the fire, during smelting.
  * Creating liquid steel for the first time
    * "Of course, when Bessemer tries to interest the world in this new process, the other
      steelmakers ignored him, assuming that it was yet another swindle. They insisted that it was
      impossible to create steel from liquid iron, and that Bessemer was a con artist. In the end he
      saw no option but to setu p his own steel works and just start making the stuff himself. After
      a few years the firm of Henry Bessemer & Co. was manufacturing steel so much more cheaply and
      in such larger quantities than his rival firms that they were eventually forced to license his
      process, in the end making him extremely rich and ushering in the machine age." (Awesome)
  * Gillette introducing disposable face shaving razors was the hypergrowth startup of its day.
    Amazing.
* Trusted - paper (chap 2)
  * "Despite talk of a paperless office, this has never transpired, nor does it look likely to, such
    is our trust in this material as a store of information."
  * ("The cellulose fibers of which it is made can be partially snapped in the area of maximum bend,
    allowing a permanent crease to form, while sufficient fibers remain intact for the material not
    to crack and fall apart."
  * "It is perhaps the very fragility of paper bags that makes them appealing for their task.
    Expensive clothes tend to be light and fragile, and maybe the fact that paper is all that is
    needed for their journey home reinforces this."
  * "Paper also has high cultural status: it speaks of the craft of making, or the handmade object."
  * Bank notes are made from cotton, which gives them more durability, resistance to water, and a
    different feel and sound than wood pulp paper. They're harder to reproduce.
  * "Books on shelves and on tables are a kind of internal marketing exercise, reminding us who we
    are and who we want to be. We are physical beings so it perhaps makes sense for us to identify
    and express our values using physical objects, which we like to touch and smell as well as
    read."
* Fundamental - concrete (chap 3)
  * Breaking down the chemical bonds in rocks to unlock the silicate for making concrete requires
    heating the rocks to 1450C!
  * "Cement is used to bond together bricks to make houses and stones to make monuments, but in both
    these cases it is wedged between the cracks as the minority component, an urban glue. When it is
    made into concrete by mixing it with small stones, which play the role of tiny bricks, it
    fulfills its potential to become a structural material."
  * Unlike bricks, concrete is liquid and can be poured into any shape. Buildings are "poured into
    existence."
  * Concrete in Roman times had a major flaw: cracks would compromise the structure if it was
    subject to a pulling tension. It was only durable in applications where the concrete was
    continually compressed, like the foundations of buildings.
  * Concrete is basically like stone. Reinforced concrete has properties unlike any natural
    material.
  * "When concrete reinforced with steel comes under bending stresses, the inner skeleton of steel
    soaks up the stress and protects it from the formation of large cracks. It is two materials in
    one, and it transforms concrete from a specialist material to the most multipurpose building
    material of all time."
  * "As luck would have it, steel and concrete have almost identical coefficients of expansion. In
    other words, they expand contract at almost the same rate."
    * So daily temperature cycles do not result in steel cracking the surrounding concrete.
  * "The big structures of old, such as the stone cathedrals of Europe or the Great )wall of China,
    took decades to build. The central core of the Shard, one of the tallest building sin Europe,
    took less than six months. The material enables you to think big, to dream."
    * It is much easier to work with during construction.
  * Concrete must be maintained every 50 years to prevent cracks from exposing the steel within to
    rust.
  * Self-healing concrete is under development. Bacteria and starch are embedded inside, and when a
    crack forms, the bacteria are activated and secrete calcite which repairs the crack.
  * Concrete became perceived as ugly, possibly because of the cheap, crude structures that were
    frequently made from it in the 60s: parking garages, and housing projects. But it doesn't have
    to be. See the Sydney Opera House.
  * "Concrete is literally the foundation of our whole society: it is the basis of our cities, our
    roads, our bridges, our power stations -- it is 50 percent of everything we make."
* Delicious - chocolate (chap 4)
  * The triglycerides in cocoa butter can be stacked in different arrangements. Type V is the
    densest and gives th chocolate a snap, firmness, and shiny exterior.
  * "The mechanical property of the snap is important to chocolatiers because it adds surprise and
    drama to our experience of the chocolate. For example, it allows them to create hard outer
    shells with which to encase soft centers, providing a textural contrast."
    * Imagine a flaccid chocolate bar without that characteristic snap.
  * Cocoa butter melts at body temperature.
    * "The genius of creating hot chocolate in the mouth is that the cocoa butter encapsulates the
      flavor molecules until the moment you eat it, and only then does it release its cocktail of
      more than six hundred exotic molecules into your mouth and up your nose."
    * Much of the taste comes from the smell. Like fresh brewed coffee, those molecules quickly
      dissipate by evaporating into the air.
  * "Producing quality chocolate requires a huge amount of care and attention, which is why good
    dark chocolate is expensive."
    * Like the selection of the type of cocoa bean; controlling the environmental conditions as it
      decomposes and ferments.
  * "If solid chocolate is exposed to temperatures above 20C, as a result perhaps of being left in
    the sun or in a hot car, it undergoes fundamental changes of structure. The changes can be
    spotted immediately because they result in a "bloom": fat and sugars migrate to the surface of
    the chocolate and form a whitish crystalline powder, often with a river mark pattern."
    * E.g. if melted during transport. Maybe this is why Mayans only produced chocolate drinks, and
      not bars.
  * "The food of the gods"
    * "Through sheer ingenuity, we have found a way to turn an unpromising tropical rain forest nut
      that tastes revolting into a cold, dark, brittle solid designed for one purpose only: to melt
      in your mouth, flood your senses with warm, fragrant, bittersweet flavors, and ignite the
      pleasure centers of the brain."
* Marvelous - foam (chap 5)
  * In 1931 a farmer invented/discovered aerogels. This is where a jelly has its liquid contents
    replaced with a gas, leaving the skeleton intact.
  * Silica aerogels are the lightest solid in the world with 99.8% air. They're the best insulation
    because the air pockets act as heat gaps, like double pane windows.
  * "Although aerogels are the best insulators we have, they are very expensive and it is not clear
    that even now we care about energy conservation enough to value aerogels economically. There are
    several companies selling aerogel for such thermal insulation applications, but at the moment
    the main ones are for extreme environments such as drilling operations."
  * Aerogels are routinely used by NASA as insulators for space equipment.
  * "Most people will never hold a piece of aerogel in their hand, but those who do never forget it.
    It is a unique experience. There is no weight to it that you can perceive, and its edges fade
    away so imperceptibly that it is impossible to see where the material stops and the air begins.
    Add to this its ghostly blue color and it really is like holding a piece of sky in your hand."
  * (This whole chapter was a fun love letter to aerogel).
* Imaginative - plastic (chap 6)
  * Cool chapter containing a screenplay about the origin and adoption of plastic. It quickly
    covered the world, because of the properties of each variant. Led to photo film and cinema.
* Invisible - glass (chap 7)
  * Many grains in sand are quartz, which is a crystal form of silicon dioxide. Much of the earth's
    crust is silicon and oxygen.
  * Unlike h2o, when SiO2 is melted and cooled, the solid crystals do not reform. The resulting
    material is glass.
  * When lightning strikes sand, it's hot enough to melt the quartz and create a glass shard.
  * Glass production was advanced greatly by the Romans. They figured out how to add a flux material
    so that the fire didn't need to be as hot. They also developed blown glass.
  * "Visible light does not have enough energy to allow the electrons to upgrade their seats and has
    no choice but to pass straight through the atoms. This is why glass is transparent.
    Higher-energy light, on the other hand, such as UV light, can upgrade the electrons in glass to
    the better seats, and so glass is opaque to UV light. This is why you can't get a suntan through
    glass."
  * Glass transformed chemistry, serving as its work horse. Glass containers are inert and
    transparent, perfect for chemical reactions.
* Unbreakable - graphite (chap 8)
  * In diamonds, 4 of the 6 electrons in carbon atoms are shared by other carbon atoms. This
    creates a strong chemical bond and a rigid structure.
  * Graphite is the stable form of carbon atoms, so diamonds very slowly decay to graphite.
  * The atoms share electrons within a layer (hexagonal sheets), but not across layers, so the
    material is soft.
  * All life can be converted to graphite's hexagonal structure through burning.
  * "It is important when proposing marriage that the diamond you offer, although physically
    identical to a synthetic one, was forged in the depths of the Earth a billion years ago."
  * Graphite can be transformed into diamond via pressure and heat. The accelerated process
    introduces flaws, so large synthetic diamonds are not colorless.
  * Carbon fiber is an engineered material that is stronger than diamond. And it's much lighter
    than aluminum. It transformed airplane construction and sports equipment.
  * Graphene is the thinnest, strongest, and stiffest material in the world; it conducts
    electricity, faster and with less resistance, than any other material."
  * Graphene is a single layer of graphite, one atom thick. You can make it by shaving off layers
    from graphite.
