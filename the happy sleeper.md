The happy sleeper

* Intro (Chap 1)

  * This is a system to transfer the role of soothing to your child.
  * Expect transformation in 2 weeks.
  * Newborns outgrow our soothing devices quickly, but we cling to them. Doing so masks the child's natural
    soothing abilities. It's over-helping.
  * Parents get frustrated and turn to a harsh shut-the-door approach to get the kids to develop their
    soothing habits.
  * When enabling your child to self-soothe, we don't want baby to feel alone or fearful.
  * Core ideas:
    * Kids need warmth and sense that the world is a safe place.
    * Kids need structure and routine

* The approach (Chap 2)

  * The debate is usually comparing "crying it out" vs secure attachment from attachment therapy. It's a false
    dichotomy.
  * You can be there and support your child as they fall asleep: just be thoughtful and consistent, to help
    them form their new behavior -- to pass on the soothing responsibility to them.
  * Consistency
    * Children have *very strong* associative learning. They are pattern seekers. Use this to both of your
      advantages.
      * Children are also quick to let go of old patterns.
    * "This is super important": sleep problems arose from even small inconsistencies. Consistency is a
      powerful driver about how they learn.

  * Attunement
    * Babies need our warmth and soothing touch to feel bonded.
    * Attachment theory is misinterpreted to mean "just stick by them". In addition to sticking by your child,
      it also means empowering them to be independent. Give them enough room so they can actually practice
      their skill of going to sleep.
    * Kids need to struggle to learn. Same as watching them struggle with math problems. If you sit next to
      them at night, they don't have the chance to struggle and learn to sleep.
    * Attunement is: "I'm here and I'm watching, but I'm letting you try on your own, and I know you can do
      it."

  * Parents over help, get fed up, and resort to a harsh stance. An attuned stance isn't a knee jerk reaction
    to the difficulty your kid is having, and their level of crying; it's a stance that consistently provides
    warmth and presence.
  * Insecure attachment also manifests in adults: have trouble sleeping without someone there; not comfortable
    being alone.
  * Attuned response to your child is generalizable: during the day, watch them struggle, and support gently,
    but don't step on until after awhile. Be curious.

* Toddler - 5mo to 2 years (chap 4)
  * Your toddler is capable of self soothing. But it's very common that they become dependent on you for this
    because they haven't been encouraged to do it alone.
  * Key components of this approach
    * Early and consistent bed time.
    * Regular nap schedule.
    * Soothing wave.

  * Why does your baby wake up in the night?
    * They all do. Good sleepers will self soothe again by themselves.
    * Bad sleepers call out for external help because they're looking for the soothing trick that put them to
      sleep in the first place.
  * When they wake up and the stimuli around them are different, they're disoriented and will wake up fully,
    calling out for you.

  * Bedtime
    * If they go to sleep the same way that they will wake up, they will be able to self soothe again.
    * Once she's in her crib, if there's anything you do that she can't do herself later, you must get rid of
      it from the environment. E.g. holding her, patting her back, music that's playing but which eventually
      shuts off.
  * All children go through periods of difficult sleep.
  * Lower the lights in the house an hour before bedtime. Bright lights suppress melatonin. Use a dim lamp in
    their room.
  * Keep the room cool. 65-68.

  * Early consistent bedtime
    * Early bedtime begets longer stretches of sleep.
    * Their bodies are programmed for early rising. So moving forward bedtime let's them stretch out their
      sleep.
    * If parents come home right before their bedtime, it's very stimulating for the kids.
    * The target is 11 hours of sleep.
  * Bedtimes routines
    * Highly sensitive to routine. Do the same thing each day in the same order. It's soothing.
    * Choose soothing things rather than activating activities.
    * They will have a Pavlovian-like response to the routine leading up to their descent into sleep.
    * Do slow, non-stimulating movements during the last stretch of the bedtime routine.
    * Make the last step of the routine be in the dark. E.g. turn out the lights and sing her a song.
    * Older kids will have less FOMO if they sense that everyone else is winding down too.
  * Instinct
    * Older babies get confused if the parents are still soothing them past 6 months. It suppresses what they
      want to do nature.
    * She doesn't need to be trained. She just needs to trust what she can do internally.

  * Soothing wave technique
    * Both parents need to be aligned on the overall plan.
    * Parents get confused when child protests the change.
    * Sleep wave let's you both respond to your child, while also making it clear that the baby is responsible
      for soothing.
    * Steps:
      * Put baby down awake. Say the same stately every time before leaving. "Love you; rest well." Crucial
        that it's said exactly the same every time. Both parents. Tone should be calm and matter of fact.
      * Wait for 5 minutes. Stand at the door or crib where baby can see you, and say your script, and leave.
        Only 7-10 seconds. Babies will protest for 20-60m at first. Don't add any n√©e steps like patting her
        back; she will guess if she did something different and should keep trying to get more out of you. Be
        super consistent
      * The wave: go in every 5 minutes. Convey that you're predictable. With the frequency and precision of
        your visits, she will identify your pattern, trust it, and then be satisfied soothing herself.
    * Baby will get louder and angrier. That's her testing the pattern until she determines it's reliable.
    * Use 5m intervals, not longer, so that her tears are ones of protest, not of fear and abandonment.
    * Through the crying, you are responding to your baby. You're just not taking back the baton of the
      responsibility of soothing.
    * Remember, this has worked for thousands of kids.
  * Moments of frustration are the best learning opportunities for your kids.
  * It's like when your kid asks for chocolate. You know you can act to make them temporarily happy. But it's
    not healthy for long term.
  * Supportive thoughts to soothe and encourage yourself while your baby is crying:
    * It's ok for my baby to struggle. That's how we learn.
    * I am changing a strong pattern, so she will protest.
    * I want my kid to have healthy long sleep.
    * I want my baby to have confidence in her abilities.
    * I want baby to have healthy sleep habits for a lifetime.
  * With a verbal child: even if they call out to you, it's the same principle.
  * Consistency is key. You are the steady foundation. Reliable checking ensures they don't feel fearful and
    abandoned.
  * Exude confidence in your baby. They will absorb your attitude and confidence.
  * Your job is not to be harsh to escalate. Be consistent.
  * Why it might not work
    * Parent does even a little bit of soothing during the checks, like robbing the back. The baby will want
      more of that and take longer to settle down on her own.
    * The parent who checks is anxious or exasperated.
    * The baby is overdressed.
    * Feeding happens right before bed.

* 2-6 years old (chap 5)
  * Each element in the bedroom that's part of their routine, they will need to be able to control themselves
    in case they wake up. E.g. don't tuck them in in a way that they can't do themselves.
  * Ideal sleep time is 7-8pm. (At 8pm expect, them to wake up at 7am -- 11 hours).
  * If your child wakes up at 9am, they legitimately won't feel drowsy enough to fall asleep until 9pm.
