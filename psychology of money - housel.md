  * Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.
  * On quitting his job, "the hardest thing about this was that I loved the work. And I wanted to work hard.
    But doign something you love on a schedule you can't control can feel the same as doing something you
    hate."
  * "The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising", and not simply that "I'll
    never make that mistake again."
* Intro
  * In finance and investing, people who are untrained can regularly outperform those who are far more
    knowledgeable. In what other profession is that the case? none. Argues this is because financial success
    arises from soft skills and behavior, not knowledge.
    * "The aim of this book is to use short stories to convince you that soft skills are more important than
      the technical side of money."
* No one's crazy (chap 1)
  * Why do people have different behavior with regards to money?
    * "Everyone has their own unique experience with how the world works. And what you've experienced is more
      compelling than what you learn second-hand."
    * The person who grew up in poverty / inflation vs. with the security of a trust fund
  * Studying can help you understand, but it's unlikely to impact you enough to change your behavior.
    * "no amount of studying or open-mindedness can genuinely recreate the power of fear and uncertainty" as
      you would have if you lived through a depression.
  * "Investors' willingness to bear risk depends on personal history", not intelligence or knowledge.
* Luck and risk (chap 2)
  * "If you give luck and risk their proper respect, you realize that when judging people's financial success,
  -- both your own and others -- it's never as good or as bad as it seems."
    * Gates was 1 in a million luck of attending a high school with a computer. Kent Evans, his est friend: 1
      in a million risk, dying in a high school mountaineering accident.
    * "For every Bill Gates ther eis a Kent Evans who was just as skilled and driven but ended up on the other
      side of life roulette."
  * People conclude that bad outcomes were a result of bad decisions, but like poker, we can't easily
    recognize that a decision which led to a poor result was in fact a good decision, because it had positive
    expected value but in a probabilistic scenario.
  * So we should neither blindly admire and replicate the actions of others, or avoid the actions of others
    because we assume their failures were due to poor decisions.
  * "Bill Gates once said, 'Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't
    lose.'" (the same can be said of failure)
* Never enough (chap 3)
  * On risking your current capital to chase higher rates of return: "If you risk something that is important
    to you for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make sense." (Buffet)
  * It's surprising how some with tens of millions of dollars of wealth will take aggressive risks or commit
    crimes to leap into the next level of wealth.
  * Happiness = results - expectations
  * "Social comparison is the problem here." Using wealth as a scorecard.
  * Escalating desire and risk eventually pushes you to the point of regret.
* Getting wealthy vs staying wealthy (chap 5)
  * "Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there. But keeping money
    requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear."
    * The goal to keeping wealth is "survival": being determined to be around in the market for a long time.
    * "You need short-term paranoia to keep you alive long enough to exploit long-term optimism."
  * Compounding, to be impactful, requires that an asset have many years to grow.
  * Buffet: "he didn't panic and sell during the 14 recessions he's lived through. He didn't attach himself to
    one strategy, one world view, or one passing trend."
  * Unbreakable: "more than I want big returns, I want to be financially unbreakable. And if I'm unbreakable I
    actually think I'll get the biggest returns, because I'll be able to stick around long enough for
    compounding to work wonders.""
  * A good plan acknowledges and embraces that there will be many black swans in our lifetime, and allows room
    for error in the planning.
  * Flexibility: "it comes in many forms: A frugal budget, flexible thinking, and a loose timeline -- anything
    that lets you live happily with a range of outcomes."
  * "Economies, markets, and careers often follow a similar path -- growth amid loss."
  * "Stocks lost a third of their value at least 12 times." (yeesh)
* Tails, you win: You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune (chap 6)
  * The "tail events" in some asset classes are what drive the returns. Many markets work like that -- art,
    venture capital, and even public equities. And in those, buy an index and hold, so that you are guaranteed
    to participate in the growth tail events.
  * "It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right
    and how much you lose when you're wrong." - George Soros.
* Freedom (chap 7)
  * Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.
  * "The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, 'I can do whatever I want
    today.'"
  * Argues that psychological research suggests that having control over one's life is a strong, dependable
    predictor of happiness. And it's possible that money can buy more of that.
  * On quitting his job, "the hardest thing about this was that I loved the work. And I wanted to work hard.
    But doing something you love on a schedule you can't control can feel the same as doing something you
    hate."
  * On why Americans aren't happier over time, despite increasing wealth: "Part of what's happened here is
    that we've used our greater wealth to buy bigger and better stuff. But we've simultaneously given up more
    control over our time. At best, these things cancel each other out."
  * After interviewing 1000 elderly people on what's important in life:
    * "What they did value were things like quality friendships, being part of something bigger than
      themselves, and spending quality, unstructured time with their children. 'Your kids don't want your
      money (or what your money buys) anywhere near as much as they want you. Specifically, they want you with
      them' Pillemer writes."
* Wealth is what you don't see (chap 9)
  * Spending money on expensive things will leave you with those things, but much less money.
  * Only financial assets not yet spent gives you freedom and flexibility. That's wealth.
  * "Wealth is hidden. It's income not spent. Wealth is an option not yet taken to buy something later. Its
    value lies in offering you options, flexibility, and growth to one day purchase more stuff than you could
    right now."
* Save money (chap 10)
  * One's rate of saving is entirely in one's control. How a particular investing strategy pans out is now.
  * "Spending beyond a pretty low level of materialism is mostly a reflection of ego approaching income, a way
    to spend money to show people that you have (or had) money."
* Reasonable > rational (chap 11)
  * "People do not want the mathematically optimal strategy. They want the strategy that maximizes for how
    well they sleep at night." They want a strategy which minimizes regret.
  * "The reasonable investors who love their technically imperfect strategies have an edge, because they're
    more likely to stick with those strategies. There are few financial variables more correlated to
    performance than commitment to a strategy during its lean years."
* Surprise! (chap 12)
  * The markets are not predictable because human emotion is a driver, and it's high variance.
  * "Investor Bill Bonner once described how Mr. Market works: 'He's got a 'Capitalism at Work' T-shirt on and
    a sledgehammer in his hand.'"
  * Outlier events and surprises are what have driven the major positive movement in the market in the last
    century. And they were impossible to predict.
  * "The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising", and not simply that "I'll
    never make that mistake again."
  * "An interesting quirk of investing history is that the further back you look, the more likely you are to
    be examining a world that no longer applies to today. Many investors and economists take comfort in
    knowing their forecasts are backed up by decades, even centuries, of data. But since economies evolve,
    recent history is often the best guide to the future, because ti's more likely to include important
    conditions that ar erelevant to the future."
