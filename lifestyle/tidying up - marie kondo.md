The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up

Chapter 1: philosophy of tidying

* Transforming the space into a tidy one changes your mindset and the state of the space going forward. It
  will make it much harder to regress.
* Do it in one fell swoop.
* "A messy environment reflects a messy mind."
* There are two parts to tidying: discarding, and storing.
* Storage is not the problem. Everyone focuses on putting away things that you don't need. The room is still
  full of clutter. Eventually the storage containers will become full. So start with discarding.
* Tidy by category of thing - clothes , books - not by location. Otherwise you will repeat a lot of the same
  work, because you store the same category of thing in multiple locations. You won't be able to see the
  entirety of your inventory if you do it by location.
* This book is about "special event tidying", not the mundane, essential daily activity of putting back the
  things that you've used.

Chapter 2: finish discarding first

* Discarding must happen first. Do the full discarding process before spending any energy on where to keep
  things. It's very inefficient to intermingle the two. And your storage efforts can become inappropriate
  based on how much you discard.
* Key rule for deciding what to discard:
  * Take each item in your hand, and ask, does this spark joy?
  * Don't visually sweep through a closet and make judgement. Hold each thing, each outfit, and make the
    decision. Your body will react to the object.
    * (It's possible that "joy" takes the form of "even if I never use this thing, but it helps me feel
      prepared for unexpected events."
* Do not filter items which are not in use, or haven't been used in a year, or some criteria like that. This
  will only lead to unhappiness. It's a negative lens. Instead, seek to identify what you cherish, and keep
  those things.
* Imagine if you space was only filled with the things which give you joy. How great would that be?
* Tidy by category
  * Repetition and wasted work will kill your motivation. To tidy by category, get it all out of the drawers
    and closets and gather it in one place that will allow you to make global optimization decisions. Things
    out of sight are dormant.
  * Don't start with mementos . It's the hardest category.
* Evaluation criteria to use for each object: functional value, emotional value, informational value, rarity.
* Tackle categories in this order of difficulty: clothes, books, papers, misc, mementos.
* Don't let anyone else in the family see what you've decided to throw out. It's emotionally hard for them to
  see things you've decided to part with.
* Avoid music if you can. Let the power of the rooms atmosphere which is heating up motivate you. You want
  sharp power of discernment. Music -- especially with lyrics -- blunts that discernment.

Chapter 3: tidying up by category

Clothes:

* Not all clothes come to you to be worn until they're threadbare. Some clothing items had the effect of
  teaching you which types of articles suit you or don't. Some were fun to buy, but not to wear. Their value
  has come and gone. When deciding to toss, it can be helpful to acknowledge the value with gratitude, but
  then say goodbye.
* Feel free to personify your things. Let them go and live their lives. If they have been in a drawer for
  years and forgotten about, they don't like that sad lifestyle.
* Get every piece of clothing out on the floor so you see how much you have, and better dedupe.
* Average wardrobe contains 168 items.
* Star with off seasonal clothes. Then loungewear.
* Don't downgrade everything that's now subpar to loungewear. What you wear around the house does affect your
  self image. Don't do sweats.
* The problem with storing off-season clothes
  * The problem storing off-season clothes out of sight is that often you'll forget to take them out a time
    and you'll start buying things which are similar. It's best to have everything that you have fully in
    view, so you can prune your collection and add to it whenever you need. Storing off-season separately
    clothes makes your clothing system really clumsy.
  * Off-seasonal clothes is outdated notion (especially for the Bay Area): we use pants and T-shirts all year
    round
* Plastic bins with lids is the trickiest type of storage container to use, because often you stack things on
  top of this container and can't see what's inside. So it's much harder to get access to those things and
  keep them top of mind that you have still have them.
* It's better to arrange all of your clothes together and then just keep similar things in terms of weight and
  warmth together. Don't try to categorize strictly by season, or work versus leisure. Those categories are
  too vague.

Books:

* The first step is to take them off the shelf and put them on the floor. You can't tell if a book gives you a
  thrill of joy if you're just looking at it on the shelf. Hold it, look at its cover, touch its page. Then
  you will be able to judge whether it still gives you joy, or whether you can move on from it and your life.
* Imagine if you had a bookshelf full of only books that you love and I give you joy. Wouldn't that be a great
  life? That's the goal.
* Keep only those books that will move you just see them on your shelves, even if you never plan to crack it
  open again.
* What about unread books?
  * People accumulate many unread books because it's easy to order books.
  * Timing is everything. The best time to read a book is when you first encounter it. If you keep your
    collection small, you can read books as they come in, when they're most relevant.
  * She recommends giving away old unread books. If the need to read it comes back around, order it again.

Papers:

* Generally, throw every paper out.
* You can scan anything you think you'll need a reference for taxes etc.
* If it needs an action, take it.
* Keep only a handful of files in a vertical inbox which should always be shallow. Get it done and get rid of
  it as soon as you can.
* For sentimental papers like diplomas, love letters, feel free to keep those in a box somewhere.

Gifts:

* Some find it hard to throw away unused gifts. E.g. a souvenir someone brought them that lives in a drawer
  unopened. It's valuable because somebody took their precious time to give that gift to you, so you feel bad
  just trying it away. But note that gifts are meant to be received. The joy comes in transferring the thing
  from one person to another, and the knowledge that they spent the time selecting it for you. If it's not
  useful, that doesn't mean you need to keep it. Nobody would want you to store their gift, never use it, and
  keep it in a drawer, out of a sense of obligation. Thank it for the value it's given you, enjoy the memory
  of having received it, and then let it move on with its life.

Mementos:

* Keep the ones that give you joy. Not because your kid wants you to keep their report card.

Chapter 4: storing things

* Pick a designated spot for everything you own. If you have items in your house without a home then the
  chances that they'll get lost or accumulate more clutter multiplies.
* If you have a shelf with nothing on it and you put something on it that doesn't have a home, that shelf
  becomes a dumping ground for other random things. (This is happened to me with my bookshelves -- we put
  sunglasses on there and now other trinkets).
* It's easy to maintain a house in order if you come home from work and can put down all of your things
  quickly and with no thought.
* The reason she recommends discarding before optimizing storage is because it's very easy to store things
  when you have very few things. People start with storage because it's this fun, rational problem to solve
  where you try to pack as many things you own into a given space as possible. But it's not productive. You
  shouldn't assume that everything you own is fixed, and take pride in all the random junk that you own.
  Instead we should be maximizing the amount of joy we get out of the items in our homes. "Avg joy per item"
  metric.
* Keep storage very simple. Fancy storage mechanisms mask how much clutter you really have.
* For families, it is helpful to keep each person stuff all in one room. If each person has designated places
  for their stuff in multiple places in the house, it's easy for this to result in clutter. Also, that person
  doesn't have a sense of ownership over their space. If you give a child their own room and all of their
  stuff is in that room, then they start to feel ownership of the space and keeping it tidy. You'll see that
  the child will take interest in their clothes, start dressing themselves, and organize their toys so that
  they're not a big mess.
* If you treat your belongings as if they're alive, then you can express gratitude to them when you hang them
  up up after a day's use. This will make you more appreciative of the things you have an increase the joy you
  derive from them. For instance, when you're done with your coat, thank it for keeping you warm all day. Do
  this as often as you can remember to.
* Storage is the secret act of choosing a home for each of your items. We should think about with your items
  to be happy being stored where they are. That type of mindset will help you upgrade your strategy for
  storing things and make sure they have each thing as a home.
* Clutter is caused by failure to return things to where they belong. So, storage should reduce the effort
  needed to put things away, not to take them out.

Chapter 5: tidying transforms lives

* Tiding is the process by which you select all of the things you've accumulated in your life to reflect what
  you really enjoy an what you really value. When somebody walks through a home that's well tidied, they will
  immediately get a sense of what that person is about and what they like. If you prune every book on your
  shelf to only include the ones that you love, it will become clear what field of study you're really drawn
  to, not just the ones you had to encounter as a student and professionally.
* The path that each thing took to arrive to you is special. That path makes a meaningful relationship between
  you and even a mass-market item. It's precious, which helps build gratitude for and connection to the thing,
  even if you ultimately dispose of it.
* Human beings can only take care of and cherish so many things at a given time. So choose wisely.
* Being surrounded by things that bring you joy will make you happier.
* The reason the author spent so much of her life on tidying is because she gets an immense amount of
  satisfaction and exhilaration from sending possessions on their way to be the most useful somewhere else in
  the world for someone else, and loves the idea of the universe clicking into place when an item fines it's
  true owner and gives them joy.
