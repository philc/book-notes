* Gems
  * Find a place "... with the power to help us develop into the sort of people we need to become."
  * "We need to lie on the beach not because we are light-minded or indolent, but because we can be
    so dangerously dutiful, serious, hard-working, disconnected from our body, over-cerebral and
    cautious."
  * "The view [from the plane] helps us to have more kindly thoughts about those left back at home.
    Their faults drop away against the backdrop of the Southern Alps or the Singapore Strait. We
    want to be patient and warm around them. We see the broader outlines of their lives. We'd like
    to tell them in franker, more direct terms how fond we are of them."
  * "The family holiday has little to do with the destination or the thrills of the itinerary: it
    lies in the capacity of a trip to cement the bonds of affection between family members; in the
    power of a trip to make a family."
* How to choose a destination (chap 1)
  * "Every destination has a character: that is, it emphasizes and promotes a particular aspect of
    human nature."
    * Scenes of serenity, ambition, suffering, elegance.
  * "The destination we find ourselves drawn to reflects an underlying sense of what is currently
    missing or under-supported in our lives. We are seeking, through our travels, not just to see
    new places, but also to become fuller, more complete beings."
    * Similar to what art we find beautiful.
    * Find a place "... with the power to help us develop into the sort of people we need to
      become."
* What is "exotic"? (chap 2)
  * "It merely means anywhere we yearn to go which we suspect has something important to teach us."
  * "Sadly, too often, we're shy about investigating what might really be exotic to us. We may end
    up in more cliched 'exotic' places from a shyness about locating and declaring our true
    interests. We're often still at the dawn of properly knowing ourselves."
* The suspicion of happiness (chap 3)
  * A common fear which prevents us from enjoying travel: "If I settle back, throw away my cares for
    a time and enjoy what I have, I will lose the will to strive -- which has been responsible for
    everything I have achieved to date."
    * (In my experience, I get an itch to return to "being productive" 5-7 days into any trip.)
    * "Unless we learn how to appreciate what we have, there is no point striving for more."
    * "Appreciation does not rule out compassion. Indeed, the more satisfied and rested we are, the
      more strength we have to bring to bear on the trouble of others."
* Anxiety (chap 4)
  * "We should be more careful when heading for destinations that we imagine will spare us every
    anxiety. We can go, but with a little more skepticism about our likely mood. It is rare to be
    uncomplicatedly happy for longer than fifteen minutes."
    * We're anxious creatures by nature. Travel doesn't help with that.
* The importance of the sun (chap 7)
  * We can "Feel our character changing in the sun: becoming something we like a lot more. When the
    world seems bountiful and easy (as it does in the heat), material accumulation looks less
    impressive or necessary. When we can have so much pleasure from sitting in a T-shirt and shorts
    and feasting on a feta and tomato salad, competing wildly for promotion loses its point. When it
    is so hot, there is no point even trying to read -- or think too much."
  * "We need to lie on the beach not because we are light-minded or indolent, but because we can be
    so dangerously dutiful, serious, hard-working, disconnected from our body, over-cerebral and
    cautious."
  * Seeking the sun is part of the "deeply noble search for wisdom and balance."
* Travel as a cure for shyness (chap 8)
  * Through travel, you're freeing yourself from your inhibitions. You're growing up -- and into
    yourself. Our journeys can teach us a vital skill: that of not minding so much if we
    occasionally look a fool. They may be the best conduits for developing into the more confident,
    less self-conscious people we crave to be."
* The pleasure of the airport (chap 9)
  * "The problem with the airport is that we tend to go there when we have a plane to catch. As a
    result, we are panicked, argumentative, stressed."
  * The airport is where many amazing journeys are about to begin among the people there. Do some
    people watching and speculate about what will happen tot hem.
* The pleasures of the flight (chap 10)
  * "The world feels large and we very small -- and the contrast is delightful. On this scale, the
    actions and concerns of our own lives don't really count for much. We're beautifully reminded of
    our own thorough unimportance."
  * "Across history, people have imagined their gods living on lofty mountaintops or in the sky,
    looking down benignly on human life. It's not a random association: from this height we can
    smile gently at humanity and perhaps love it a little, too."
  * "The view helps us to have more kindly thoughts about those left back at home. Their faults drop
    away against the backdrop of the Southern Alps or the Singapore Strait. We want to be patient
    and warm around them. We see the broader outlines of their lives. We'd like to tell them in
    franker, more direct terms how fond we are of them."
  * "As we start the descent, helped by the complex maneuvers of the plane through the lower
    atmosphere, we dream of becoming the people we long to be."
* Pretty cities (chap 11)
  * "We crave architectural and civic beauty, because we intuitively appreciate how much we are at
    the mercy of our architectural environments."
  * "In the best cities, the streets whisper of hope, dignity, community and friendship."
  * "In utopia, architecture would more fairly be interpreted as a branch of mental health."
* The importance of family holidays (chap 15)
  * "The family holiday has little to do with the destination or the thrills of the itinerary: it
    lies in the capacity of a trip to cement the bonds of affection between family members; in the
    power of a trip to make a family."
  * "There are associated benefits in experiencing danger together: in being caught out in a
    rainstorm after the museum, in getting lost in the bazaar, in needing to sort out a stolen
    wallet, in having to find somewhere to sleep at 11pm. At the time, these discomforts feel like
    an interruption of the real point of the trip. Only later do we realize that they are what
    helped us to get to know one another properly and overcome the egocentricity and reserve of
    home."
* The pleasure of the romantic minibreak (chap 16)
  * "The new surroundings have no such memories. They allow us to start afresh and rediscover
    wellsprings of affection and generosity."
* Holiday fling (chap 22)
  * "Romance becomes valid and important as an aspect of tourism because of the way it rapidly
    deepens a relationship to another person and thereby a place."
  * "We're not just looking for random company: we want to meet an individual who properly
    represents the virtues of their locality."
* Traveling for perspective (chap 23)
  * On traveling to places other than our own homes and country: "travels to places where the true
    hardships of existence are grimly evident can provide a needed education in gratitude."
* Travel and pilgrimages (chap 24)
  * "There are places that, by virtue of their remoteness, vastness, climate, chaotic energy,
    haunting melancholy or sheer difference from our homelands exert a capacity to salve the wounded
    parts of us."
  * "One of the most effective ways of achieving a feeling of distance from follies, vanity and
    sinfulness is to introduce something very large -- like the experience of a month-long journey
    across a desert or a mountain range -- between our past and our desired future."
  * "We need to relearn how to use travel as a way of being existentially healed, rather than merely
    entertained or tanned."
  * For pilgrimages, the eight-month walk across Europe to complete the pilgrimage was part of the
    point. The walk was penance and made the act big.
* How to come home (chap 26)
  * At an airport, there are travelers returning home to the place, and also travelers starting
    their journey there
    * "Once they have crossed customs, they will have before them the same monuments, museums,
      landscapes and foods."
  * "Why do we accord such privileges to foreign places, and such ready disdain to our own lands?
    Would it not be one of the greatest skills, the most helpful kind of practical wisdom, to know
    how to sample a little of the excitement about our own countries that travelers are able to
    locate there?"
  * "Consider how much you might notice if you walked out of the front door, and imagined you had
    never seen any of it before."
  * "'Boring home' is always someone else's deeply exciting 'abroad'."
* Cherishing memories (chap 28)
  * "Part of why we feel the need for so many new experiences may simply be that we are so bad at
    absorbing the ones we had."
    * We have some awesome experience, but then we shove it to the back of our minds forever.
