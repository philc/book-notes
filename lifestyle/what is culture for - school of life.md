# What Is Culture For - School of Life

## Gems

* "Strangely, it appears that certain imaginary friends drawn from culture can end up feeling more
  real and in that sense more present to us than any of our real-life acquaintances, even if they
  have been dead a few centuries and lived on another continent. We can feel honored to count them
  as among our best friends."
* "There's a strange contrast we sometimes catch sight of around parents and children. The child
  might be joyfully singing and dancing along to a favorite song. As they watch, the parent's
  delight has a different quality: they are deeply conscious of how fragile and fleeting such
  moments of intense happiness are; they see this lovely, innocent moment against the backdrop of
  life's sorrows and troubles -- adding a layer of poignancy and tenderness which the child can't as
  yet imagine. And this is what makes the sight so moving to the parent."
* "'When two people part, it is the one who is not in love who makes the tender speeches.' The
  clarity won't make the lover return; but it will do the next best thing: help us to feel less
  confused by, and alone with, the misery of having been left."

## Intro

* "Rather than focus on what a work of art might tell us about the time and place it was made or
  about the person who created it, we should develop the confidence to do exactly that which we
  might feel discouraged to do: relate cultural masterpieces to our own dilemmas and pains."

## Companionship (chap 1)

* "The legacy of Romanticism has been an epidemic of loneliness, as we are repeatedly brought up
  against the truth: the radical inability of any one other person to wholly grasp who we truly
  are."
* "Art can, for adults, function as more sophisticated versions of transitional objects. What we are
  at heart looking for in friendship is not necessarily someone we can touch and see in front of us,
  but a person who shares, and can help us develop, our sensibility and our values."
* "Strangely, it appears that certain imaginary friends drawn from culture can end up feeling more
  real and in that sense more present to us than any of our real-life acquaintances, even if they
  have been dead a few centuries and lived on another continent. We can feel honored to count them
  as among our best friends."
* "Confronted by the many failings of our real life communities, culture gives us the option of
  assembling a tribe for ourselves, drawing its members from across the widest ranges of time and
  space, blending some living friends with some dead authors, architects, musicians and composers,
  painters and poets."
* "So we can confront the difficult stretches of existence not simply on the basis of our own small
  resources, but accompanied by the accumulated wisdom of the kindest, most intelligent voices of
  all ages gone by."

## Hope (chap 2)

* "There's a strange contrast we sometimes catch sight of around parents and children. The child
  might be joyfully singing and dancing along to a favorite song. As they watch, the parent's
  delight has a different quality: they are deeply conscious of how fragile and fleeting such
  moments of intense happiness are; they see this lovely, innocent moment against the backdrop of
  life's sorrows and troubles -- adding a layer of poignancy and tenderness which the child can't as
  yet imagine. And this is what makes the sight so moving to the parent."
* In defense of sweet / sentimental art
  * "It's because we're burdened with frustrations, disappointments, failings, errors, regrets and
    compromises that the sight of grace, innocence, lightness and carefree joy is so moving; and if
    we cry it is because we're glimpsing something we love and need and yet cannot now hold on to."

## Balance (chap 3)

* Helpful framing of art: art is produced to supply us with what we lack emotionally, thus helping
  us achieve emotional balance. Art that does this is considered beautiful. Since everyone has
  different emotional shortages, everyone has different tastes in art.
* Film can educate us by example, and deliver a balancing view to what we're missing. That's why
  there's so many genre of film.
* "Our tastes will depend on what spectrum of our emotional makeup lies in shadow and is hence in
  need of stimulation and emphasis."

## Compassion (chap 4)

* Nice advocacy for the Tolstoy novel Anna Karenina, and how novels like that develop our powers of
  sympathy by showing how unfortunate characters can get there, step by step.

## Knowledge (chap 5)

* Literate is a reality simulation which teaches us what befalls us if we behave in certain ways. Or
  more generally, what humanity is like.
* "'When two people part, it is the one who is not in love who makes the tender speeches.' The
  clarity won't make the lover return; but it will do the next best thing: help us to feel less
  confused by, and alone with, the misery of having been left."

## Encouragement (chap 6)

* Architecture: "the most imposing of the arts."
  * "In the company of the right building (as in the company of the right friend) we find it easier
    to become the better versions of who we really are."
* "The Parliament building in Dhaka, like many a beautiful city, street, chair or teapot, matters
  because of its skill at encouraging the better sides of us."

## Appreciation (chap 7)

* "[We] are prone to racing through the years while forgetting the wonder, fragility and beauty of
  existence. It's fortunate, therefore, that we have art."
* Art is a form of advertising to remind us of what is good and beautiful
  * "If advertising images carry a lot of the blame for instilling a sickness in our souls, the
    images of artists reconcile us with our realities and reawaken us to the genuine, but too-easily
    forgotten, value of our lives."
* "Art doesn't have to tantalize us with alluring visions of things we can never attain. It's
  capable of drawing our admiration to the easily forgotten, but very real, charms and dignity of
  everyday life."

## Perspective (chap 8)

* Concerning grand scenes of nature, "We regain composure not by being made to feel more important,
  but by being reminded of the minuscule and momentary nature of everyone and everything."
