  * Summary: People are helpful more often than not. They don't think less of you for needing help. Helping,
    with the right reinforcers in place, feels wonderful. There is no better way to give someone the
    opportunity to feel good about themselves than to ask them to help you. It brings out the best feelings in
    all of us.
  * Asking for help makes you more likable. Ben Franklin's library book anecdote.
  * Helping boosts one's mood because it's prosocial behavior.
  * Feeling compelled to help erases the self-esteem benefits.
  * As a help-giver, frame the inbound request such that you can give an "enthusiastic yes!". You will feel
    better about the whole situation and get the self-esteem benefits.
  * Don't create distance when asking for help: overdoing empathy, apologizing profusely, using disclaimers,
    saying how much they'll enjoy helping, minimizing the magnitude of your request.
  * When showing gratitude, praise the giver's identity, not their act, and not how much their help is
    benefiting you. People like to be helpers, not to give help.
  * Create an in-group. It connects, and motivates each member to help each other. Emphasize shared
    experiences. E.g. "We're on the same journey together." "We're both always trying to help our teams."

* Asking for help makes us feed bad (chap 1)
  * A list of psychological experiments surfacing just how terrifying it is to ask a random stranger for a
    favor.
  * "In many instances, we ask for help in such a way that we make people feel controlled, rather than giving
    them what they need to really want to help us -- and to make helping us rewarding."
  * Transparency illusion
    * We expect to get help without asking, but this never happens.
    * "The hard truth is that, if you aren't getting the support you need from the people in your life, it's
      usually more your own fault than you realize."
  * "Love and belonging might seem like a convenience we can live without, but our biology is built to thirst
    for connection because it is linked to our most basic survival needs."
* We assume others will say no (chap 2)
  * In summary: But it's hard to say no.
  * Why do we underestimate how likely people are to do favors?
    * There's a lot of psychological, interpersonal pressure for people to say yes. If they like you, it will
      hurt them to say no. And they don't want to let you down.
    * We're concerned only with inconveniencing the help giver. "Even though we've all been help givers, we
      fail to consider the perspective of *other* help givers when we most need to."
  * Direct face-to-face requests are far more awkward to refuse.
  * Most people... just want to be helpful.
  * Underestimating the helpfulness of people who've previously said no
    * Repeated requests get harder to decline, because the refuser begins to see themselves as a bad person.
      They can't be busy all the time, can they?
  * "Door in the face" technique from Influence
    * Used by salespeople: ask for something they're likely to say no to. Then retreat from the request to a
      lesser request, and they're much more likely to say yes.
  * Asking someone for help who has said yes in the past yields higher response rates, because of the need to
    be consistent.
  * Remember that it's generally as hard to say no to requests as it is to ask for help.
* We assume asking for help makes us less likable (chap 3)
  * Reverse that conception -- the truth is, it makes you more likable. This will make you more comfortable
    asking for help.
  * (Ben Franklin's library book anecdote: requesting to borrow a book from his enemy's library made him into
    a great, lifelong friend)
  * Three types of people:
    * Givers: prefer to have the generosity scales always tipped in their favor
    * Takers
    * Matchers: like to be fair and even
  * People classified as "givers" tend to be the most successful
    * "They have the richest, deepest network of connections and supporters, exert a profound influence on
      those around them, and like a rising tide, seem to win not by defeating others but by creating
      situations that lift everyone's boat.
  * Helping boosts your mood
    * There's a warm glow after prosocial behavior.
    * Lending a hand makes us feel wonderful, useful, and can erase a bad mood.
  * Argues that money can buy happiness if you spend it on other people
    * "If you really want to improve your quality of life, try spending money on other people."
    * "Personal spending was completely unrealted to happiness, but prosocial spending -- spending on others
      -- predicted reliably greater happiness."
* The inherent paradox in asking for help (chap 4)
  * People want to be helpful, but don't want to feel compelled to; feeling compelled destroys the benefits
    they get from being a giver. Asking for help often creates this feeling of compulsion.
  * Ways the giver can react to a request:
    * Outright no. Fairly rare. It's hard to give a clean and untroubled no when someone asks you.
    * Ignore. Let the urgency of the request die down.
    * Grudging yes. The giver will not derive satisfaction. This is the worst reaction.
    * Enthusiastic yes: this is strategically the best response. It sets you up, as the giver, to feel good
      about yourself.

  * As a help-giver, frame the inbound request such that you can give an "enthusiastic yes!". You will feel
    better about the whole situation.
    * (I did this once with Alon while at Liftoff and I felt better about it).
  * Help-givers need to feel autonomy. It gives you energy.
    * Like they chose to help, rather than they had to.
    * Tasks for which you are intrinsically motivated replenish your energy rather than deplete it. It's
      powerful.
      * (Research shows that the tasks don't have to make you happy / put you in a good mood; just have to be
        engaging).
    * Feeling controlled, or micro-managed, takes away your energy and makes you unhappy. This feeling is
      caused by rewards, threats, surveillance, and deadlines associated with a task. Rewards displace the
      giver's intrinsic motivation.
  * How do we inadvertently make people feel compelled to help?
    * "Good people are helpful, we think to ourselves on some level, so if we choose not to help, where does
      that leave us? Also, rejecting another person in need creates an awkward tension that isn't easily
      resolved, even when we offer apologies and justifications for the rejection."
    * First asking "can you do me a favor?"
      * This gets the person to pre-commit. It creates resentment.
      * This is a tactic from Influence. It does create much higher response rates. But it's only a good
        tactic in single-turn games, not long-term relationships.
    * "Awkwardness can arise when two people read their reciprocity type differently. Someone I thought of as
      a friend asked me if I would watch her cat when she went on vacation, which I was happy to do, until she
      offered me $100 to do it. I was uncomfortable and insulted."
    * "Avoidance is how we get around the dilemma of feeling controlled by other people's requests for help."
  * (This chapter didn't really answer hoe we avoid making the giver feel controlled. Consider re-reading this
    chapter).
* The four steps to getting the help you need (chap 5)
  * Step 1: the helper needs to notice that you might need help
    * People are bombarded with sights and sounds and there are many who need help, so it's not easy to notice
      which cases really require attention.
  * Step 2: the helper needs to believe that you desire help
    * They don't know if it's really needed -- others might be inbound to help --, and they don't know if it's
      welcomed -- there's embarrassment if they misinterpret whether you really need help. *
    * Solution: explicitly ask for help, even if it's uncomfortable.
    * The norm of family privacy is that helpers don't step in to domestic issues because they don't want to
      violate domestic privacy.
  * Step 3: the helper needs to take responsibility for helping
    * When there are too many potential helpers, like on a city street, it causes diffusion of responsibility.
      So we don't help. It's not callousness, but confusion about our role.
    * So, avoid group emails which ask for help. Single someone out and eliminate the confusion and give them
      a clear sense of responsibility.
    * Experiment results: when hearing someone have a seizure, the more people you think heard it, the less
      likely you are to go seek help for them.
  * Step 4: the helper needs to be able to provide the help you need
    * If they are busy and feel interrupted, they will give you less/no help. Be clear about what you need and
      how much time it will take.
    * Princeton Good Samaritan Study, where seminary students who were told they were late stepped over
      someone in need.
* Don't make it weird (chap 6)
  * (Great chapter)
  * Anecdote about a professor giving up his business class seat to a friend of his mother's: "after giving
    her my seat and seeing how happy she became, I sat in economy with the biggest smile for an hour. I felt
    massive joy. I was really surprised by the intensity of my own joy in having done that, in being a person
    who did such a thing. There were two very happy people on the flight that day.
    * Just think how differently Thomas would have felt had his mother's friend realized he was in business
      class, walked up to him, and said, "Young Tommy, would you mind trading seats?"
  * Ways to make it weird (i.e. ways to create distance)
    * Overdoing it on empathy
    * Apologizing profusely
      * It feels controlling.
      * Apologies are distancing. Instead, it should feel like you're on the same team, leaning on each other.
        You don't apologize when your teammates help.
    * Using disclaimers
      * "I don't normally ask for help, but..."
      * Even if you are a bit uncomfortable about asking for help, try not to telegraph it to the help giver.
        Keep it positive and relaxed, and worry a little less about how you look and a little more about how
        they feel.
    * Emphasizing how much the other person will love helping
      * While true, doing so reeks of manipulating and control.
    * Portraying the help you need as a tiny, insignificant favor
      * It's minimizing and feels manipulative.
      * Don't risk underestimating the work: "proofreading my email should be quick; it's almost good."
      * "Would you add these updates to the database? It probably won't take you more than five minutes." The
        thing is, by minimizing our request, we also minimize the helper's help and thus minimize any warm
        feelings the act of helping us might have generated."
    * Reminding people that they owe you one
      * Feels controlling. Also, calling in favors should be done close to the time of the favor. The feeling
        of debt fades with time. And no one likes to do things out of obligation.
    * Talking about how much their help will benefit you
      * "Doing gratitude right": helpers, like all people, are ego-centric. The motivation to help stems from
        improving one's identity and self-esteem. So, direct your gratitude to speak to that, rather than
        making the gratitude about yourself and how much you've been helped.
      * Other-praising:
        * "it shows how responsible you are"
        * "you go out of your way"
        * "I feel like you're really good at that"
      * Self-benefit (avoid):
        * It let me relax.
        * It gave me bragging rights at work.
        * It makes me happy.
* In in-group reinforcement (chap 7)
  * Much of the brain's hardware is dedicated to processing social signals.
  * "Group membership is an essential component of our identity. It contributes in large part to our sense of
    who we are and what we're all about."
  * We want to be helpful to the groups we're in, like college alums and our family, because our identity is
    tied to the group, and if the group succeeds, we feel like we succeed.
  * Getting someone to think that we're in the same group together predisposes them to want to help us and
    like us.
  * Use the word "together"
    * The word together is a powerful social cue to the brain. In and of itself, it seems to serve as a kind
      of relatedness reward, signaling that you belong, that you are connected, and that there are people you
      can trust working with you toward the same goal.
  * Highlight shared goals
    * Shared goals creates a strong sense of shared identity. So does having a shared enemy.
    * You can begin your request for help by highlighting a shared goal. "Sanjay, I know your team is also
      working on ways to expand our client base. I've got a project I could use your expertise on..."
  * Talk about shared experiences and feelings, not shared objective traits
    * Create a bond with the other by saying "Have you noticed we're the two on the team who interrupted all
      the time?"
    * "Fellow travelers on the same journey." (NTS: this feels good to say, and widely applicable)
    * The best team-building events are ones where you build a shared experience and a shared sentiment with
      each other.
* The positive identity reinforcement (chap 8)
  * The benefits of high self-esteem & liking yourself:
    * It says "yes, you can."
    * "It gives you the confidence and resilience to push through the rough times. Research shows that people
      with high self-esteem experience more positive and less negative emotions overall. They engage in more
      effective coping strategies and persist longer when things go wrong. They have greater psychological
      protection from debilitating life events, like the loss of a job, relationship, or loved one. And they
      enjoy superior health outcomes across the board, including faster recovery from illness or surgery."
  * If our acts of generosity are attributed by us or others to our identity -- "I am a helpful person" --
    it's a powerful positive reinforcement. Much more so than being called "helpful." Kids like to be helpers,
    not just to help.
    * Take away: when praising someone, describe and applaud their identity, not just their actions. What kind
      of person they are.
  * People make bigger contributions to charity when asked if they would like to be a "generous donor" than
    they do if they are simply asked to donate.
  * Gratitude is a glue that binds you and your benefactor together, allowing you to hit the same well over
    and over again when you need support, knowing that it won't run dry.
  * The identity of the giver is what's important for getting good help, not yours.
  * Giving of the self --giving something only you can give -- results in an increased subjective value of the
    donation by the giver. They value their possessions and time more than others do, because it's *theirs*.
    * Diffusion of responsibility cheapens the value of the help; if anyone else could've stepped in to help
      in the same way, it's not unique and my contribution is less.
* The effectiveness reinforcement (chap 9)
  * Higgens argued that the desire to feel effective -- to know what's real, manage what happens, and achieve
    the outcomes you're looking for -- is what truly engages people and gives their lives meaning.
  * It's all about impact. "If I donate money to your cause without a clear sense of the tangible impact my
    money is having on the lives of others, what gratification can I really derive from it?"
  * Helpers want to feel like they are being impactful, and seeing the impact refuels their tank.
  * How to increase your helper's sense of effectiveness
    * Make it clear and explicit what type and level of impact you expect to result from their help. Avoid
      vague appeals, like "I'd like to pick your brain" -- they can't connect how that vague help will result
      in some outcome.
    * Follow-up afterward; let them know in advance that you will. This increases their confidence that they'll
      end up feeling effective.
