* Asking for help makes us feed bad (chap 1)
  * A list of psychological experiments surfacing just how terrifying it is to ask a random stranger for a
    favor...
  * "In many instances, we ask for help in such a way that we make people feel controlled, rather than giving
    them what they need to really want to help us -- and to make helping us rewarding."
  * Transparency illusion
    * We expect to get help without asking, but this never happens.
    * "The hard truth is that, if you aren't getting the support you need from the people in your life, it's
      usually more your own fault than you realize."
  * "Love and belonging might seem like a convenience we can live without, but our biology is built to thirst
    for connection because it is linked to our most basic survival needs."
* We assume others will say no (chap 2)
  * In summary: But it's hard to say no.
  * Why do we underestimate how likely people are to do favors?
    * There's a lot of psychological, interpersonal pressure for people to say yes. If they like you, it will
      hurt them to say no. And they don't want to let you down.
    * We're concerned only with inconveniencing the help giver. "Even though we've all been help givers, we
      fail to consider the perspective of *other* help givers when we most need to."
  * Direct face-to-face requests are far more awkward to refuse.
  * Most people... just want to be helpful.
  * Underestimating the helpfulness of people who've previously said no
    * Repeated requests get harder to decline, because the refuser begins to see themselves as a bad person.
      They can't be busy all the time, can they?
  * "Door in the face" technique from Influence
    * Used by salespeople: ask for something they're likely to say no to. Then retreat from the request to a
      lesser request, and they're much more likely to say yes.
  * Asking someone for help who has said yes in the past yields higher response rates, because of the need to
    be consistent.
  * Remember that it's generally as hard to say no to requests as it is to ask for help.
* We assume asking for help makes us less likable (chap 3)
  * Reverse that conception -- the truth is, it makes you more likable. This will make you more comfortable
    asking for help.
  * (Ben Franklin's library book anecdote: requesting to borrow a book from his enemy's library made him into
    a great, lifelong friend)
  * Three types of people:
    * Givers: prefer to have the generosity scales always tipped in their favor
    * Takers
    * Matchers: like to be fair and even
  * People classified as "givers" tend to be the most successful
    * "They have the richest, deepest network of connections and supporters, exert a profound influence on
      those around them, and like a rising tide, seem to win not by defeating others but by creating
      situations that lift everyone's boat.
  * Helping boosts your mood
    * There's a warm glow after prosocial behavior.
    * Lending a hand makes us feel wonderful, useful, and can erase a bad mood.
  * Argues that money can buy happiness if you spend it on other people
    * "If you really want to improve your quality of life, try spending money on other people."
    * "Personal spending was completely unrealted to happiness, but prosocial spending -- spending on others
      -- predicted reliably greater happiness."
