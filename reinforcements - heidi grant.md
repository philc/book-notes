* Asking for help makes us feed bad (chap 1)
  * A list of psychological experiments surfacing just how terrifying it is to ask a random stranger for a
    favor...
  * "In many instances, we ask for help in such a way that we make people feel controlled, rather than giving
    them what they need to really want to help us -- and to make helping us rewarding."
  * Transparency illusion
    * We expect to get help without asking, but this never happens.
    * "The hard truth is that, if you aren't getting the support you need from the people in your life, it's
      usually more your own fault than you realize."
  * "Love and belonging might seem like a convenience we can live without, but our biology is built to thirst
    for connection because it is linked to our most basic survival needs."
* We assume others will say no (chap 2)
  * In summary: But it's hard to say no.
  * Why do we underestimate how likely people are to do favors?
    * There's a lot of psychological, interpersonal pressure for people to say yes. If they like you, it will
      hurt them to say no. And they don't want to let you down.
    * We're concerned only with inconveniencing the help giver. "Even though we've all been help givers, we
      fail to consider the perspective of *other* help givers when we most need to."
  * Direct face-to-face requests are far more awkward to refuse.
  * Most people... just want to be helpful.
  * Underestimating the helpfulness of people who've previously said no
    * Repeated requests get harder to decline, because the refuser begins to see themselves as a bad person.
      They can't be busy all the time, can they?
  * "Door in the face" technique from Influence
    * Used by salespeople: ask for something they're likely to say no to. Then retreat from the request to a
      lesser request, and they're much more likely to say yes.
  * Asking someone for help who has said yes in the past yields higher response rates, because of the need to
    be consistent.
  * Remember that it's generally as hard to say no to requests as it is to ask for help.
* We assume asking for help makes us less likable (chap 3)
  * Reverse that conception -- the truth is, it makes you more likable. This will make you more comfortable
    asking for help.
  * (Ben Franklin's library book anecdote: requesting to borrow a book from his enemy's library made him into
    a great, lifelong friend)
  * Three types of people:
    * Givers: prefer to have the generosity scales always tipped in their favor
    * Takers
    * Matchers: like to be fair and even
  * People classified as "givers" tend to be the most successful
    * "They have the richest, deepest network of connections and supporters, exert a profound influence on
      those around them, and like a rising tide, seem to win not by defeating others but by creating
      situations that lift everyone's boat.
  * Helping boosts your mood
    * There's a warm glow after prosocial behavior.
    * Lending a hand makes us feel wonderful, useful, and can erase a bad mood.
  * Argues that money can buy happiness if you spend it on other people
    * "If you really want to improve your quality of life, try spending money on other people."
    * "Personal spending was completely unrealted to happiness, but prosocial spending -- spending on others
      -- predicted reliably greater happiness."
* The inherent paradox in asking for help (chap 4)
  * People want to be helpful, but don't want to feel compelled to; feeling compelled destroys the benefits
    they get from being a giver. Asking for help often creates this feeling of compulsion.
  * Ways the giver can react to a request:
    * Outright no. Fairly rare. It's hard to give a clean and untroubled no when someone asks you.
    * Ignore. Let the urgency of the request die down.
    * Grudging yes. The giver will not derive satisfaction. This is the worst reaction.
    * Enthusiastic yes: this is strategically the best response. It sets you up, as the giver, to feel good
      about yourself.
  * So, frame the request so that you can give an enthusiastic yes. (I did this once with Alon while at
    Liftoff and it felt better).
  * Help-givers need to feel autonomy. It gives you energy.
    * Like they chose to help, rather than they had to.
    * Tasks for which you are intrinsically motivated replenish your energy rather than deplete it. It's
      powerful.
        * (Research shows that the tasks don't have to make you happy / put you in a good mood; just have to
          be engaging).
    * Feeling controlled, or micro-managed, takes away your energy and makes you unhappy. This feeling is
      caused by rewards, threats, surveillance, and deadlines associated with a task. Rewards displace the
      giver's intrinsic motivation.
  * How do we inadvertently make people feel compelled to help?
    * "Good people are helpful, we think to ourselves on some level, so if we choose not to help, where does
      that leave us? Also, rejecting another person in need creates an awkward tension that isn't easily
      resolved, even when we offer apologies and justifications for the rejection."
    * First asking "can you do me a favor?"
      * This gets the person to pre-commit. It creates resentment.
      * This is a tactic from Influence. It does create much higher response rates. But it's only a good
        tactic in single-turn games, not long-term relationships.
    * "Awkwardness can arise when two people read their reciprocity type differently. Someone I thought of as
      a friend asked me if I would watch her cat when she went on vacation, which I was happy to do, until she
      offered me $100 to do it. I was uncomfortable and insulted."
    * "Avoidance is how we get around the dilemma of feeling controlled by other people's requests for help."
  * (This chapter didn't really answer hoe we avoid making the giver feel controlled. Consider re-reading this
    chapter).
