# How to Avoid a Climate Disaster - Bill Gates

## This will be hard (chap 2)

* The world uses 4 billion gallons of oil per day. Oil is $1 per gallon. Cheap, and at scale. But
  the price doesn't capture the negative externalities.
* Population is climbing; energy requirements per person are climbing as people in developing
  countries improve their quality of life and live like the people in rich countries.
* The natural pace of transition to new energy sources is slow. It was 60 years before natural gas
  constituted 25% of our energy consumption -- and that's with better economics being the reason for
  adoption (it became cheaper than coal), which is the most powerful motivation to adopt.
* "The energy industry is simply enormous -- at around $5 trillion a year, one of the biggest
  businesses on the planet. Anything that big and complex will resist change."
* Energy tech does not have a Moore's Law improvement curve.

## Five questions to ask in every climate conversation (chap 3)

* "How much of the 51 billion tons are we talking about?"
  * No effort that, when scaled, is less than 1% of the goal (i.e. less than 500M tons) should
    compete for climate change resources.
* "What's your plan for cement?"
  * 31% of emissions is making things: cement, steel, plastic.
* "How much power are we talking about?"
  * Alternative energy sources need to be able to produce at huge scale to be relevant.
  * The world: 5,000 gigawatts
  * USA: 1,000 gigawatts (10^12)
  * Mid-size city: 1 gigawatt (10^9)
  * Small town: 1 megawatt (10^6)
  * Average American house: 1 kilowatt (10^3)
* "How much space do you need?"
  * Power density: watts per square meter.
    * Solar is 5-10x the power density of wind, so if you want to use wind, you'll need a lot more
      land.
* "How much is all of this going to cost?"
  * Argues DAC (direct air capture) is going to be inherently inefficient and costly, and only works
    on CO2, not methane and other greenhouse gases. So it's unlikely to be the silver bullet in our
    given time frame.

## How we plug in (chap 4)

* 27% of 51 billion tons per year.
* "If we get zero-carbon electricity, we can use it to help decarbonize lots of other activities,
  like how we get around and how we make things."
* How to handle the intermittency problem
  * For seasonal variation, augment renewables with nuclear, or natural gas plants, which capture
    their own emissions.
* The U.S. grid is not able to transmit power to states far away. Doing so requires long-distance
  high-voltage lines to be run across the country.
* As homes switch to carbon-free energy consumption (less fossil fuels, more electricity due to e.g.
  electric cars) homes will need 2x more electricity, and heavier local grid infrastructure. All
  power lines will need to be changed.
* "It's hard to foresee a future where we decarbonize our power grid affordably without using more
  nuclear power."
* Nuclear fusion: the same process that powers the sun.

## How we make things (chap 5)

* 31% of the 51 billion tons per year
* Plastic doesn't biodegrade, because it contains carbon. Plastic could be a carbon sink in this
  way.
* Path to zero emissions manufacturing:
  * Electrify every process possible.
  * Get that electricity from a power grid that's been decarbonized.
  * Use carbon capture to absorb the remaining emissions.
  * Use materials more efficiently

## How we grow things (chap 6)

* 19% of the 51 billion tons per year
* Methane and nitrous oxide constitute 80% of the greenhouse gas impact from agriculture.
* Chicken: consumes 2 calories per calorie of poultry meat.
* Cows: 6-1
* For 1 billion cows, "the methane they burp and fart out every year has the same warming effect as
  2 billion tons of carbon dioxide, accounting for about 4 percent of all global emissions."
* "About half of poop-related emissions come from pig manure, and the rest from cow manure. There's
  so much animal poop that it's actually the second-biggest cause of emissions in agriculture,
  behind enteric fermentation."

## How we get around (chap 7)

* 16% of the 51 billion tons per year
* "It's aviation, trucking, and shipping -- not passenger cars -- that account for all the emissions
  growth in this sector."
* Passenger cars: 1B of them on the road world-wide.
* Buses and garbage trucks are light enough that they can be electrified, and many are.
* Heavy vehicles needing long range, like trucks and ships, cannot run on batteries. They're simply
  too heavy.
* Gas delivers higher energy efficiency -- 25x more energy per pound of fuel than do batteries. This
  is why heavy longer-range vehicles like planes cannot use batteries.
* Jets will need electrofuels and advanced biofuels.
* Nuclear-powered container ships?
* "With transportation, the zero-carbon future is basically this: use electricity to run all the
  vehicles we can, and get cheap alternative fuels for the rest."

## How we keep cool and stay warm (chap 8)

* 7% of the 51 billion tons per year
* AC draws from the electrical grid, so we can decarbonize this by providing clean energy. Also ACs
  can be twice as efficient, it's just people don't buy the most efficient versions. Regulation here
  can help.
* Gas heaters can be replaced by electric heat pumps. They are widely available and carry a negative
  green premium. Adoption is low because the cycle time on replacing gas heaters is slow.
* Biofuels can be used as fuel in current heaters, but have a large green premium.

## Adapting to a warmer world (chap 9)

* Africa is responsible for only 2% of global emissions. We should be funding adaptation in that
  country, not trying to lower its emissions.

## A plan for getting to zero (chap 11)

* On private vs. public investment in R&D: "Fear of failure makes private R&D portfolios
  shortsighted. They tend to skew toward safer investments that could and should be funded by the
  private sector. The real value of government leadership in R&D is that it can take chances on bold
  ideas that might fail or might not pay off right away."
