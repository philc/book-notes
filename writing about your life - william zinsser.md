* Gems
  * Convey a sense of enjoyment
    * "Given a choice between two projects -- one that you feel you ought to write and one that
      sounds like fun -- go for the one you'll enjoy working on. It will show in your writing. The
      reader should always think that the writer is feeling good."
  * "Almost every family wants -- and deserves -- to have some kind of record left behind of its
    effort to be a family. If your sister has a problem with your version of the story, she can
    write her own version. Each will have its own integrity. The integrity of the product should be
    your goal."
  * "What I took away from the Book-of-the-Month Club was a belief that the best books -- the most
    enduring books and the most useful books -- are written out of some inner core of conviction."
  * "I choose to write about people whose values I respect and who do life-affirming work; my
    pleasure is to bear witness to their lives. Much of my writing has taken the form of a
    pilgrimage: to sacred places that represent the best of America, to musicians and other
    artists who represent the best of their art."
  * "Most people are on some kind of pilgrimage, whether or not they recognize it as such. If you
    put your writing in the form of a quest you will make a connection with your readers that will
    surprise you with its power."
  * "There are two ways to think about separation: as a loss, or as a beginning. To separate is to
    start fresh. For you, I hope today will be the first of many separations that will mean
    putting behind you something you've done well and beginning something you'll do just as well,
    or better."
  * "Bad writing is tired and predictable; nobody wants a cautious writer. When you write, call on
    the best of your character. And make sure you're living the life you want to live."
  * "'If you feel a certain emotion while you're playing the piano', he kept assuring me, 'your
    listeners will feel it, too.'" -- "I give the same advice to writers."
  * "When I sometimes feel a twinge of disappointment if the crowd at one of my gigs is smaller than
    I expected, I hear Mitchell saying, 'It's a privilege to play for one other person.' That credo
    has helped me through many thin situations, both as a public pianist and as a public speaker.
    I've stopped worrying about conditions that I can't control or change. I just do what I came to
    do, as well as I can."
    * "That's also all you can do as a writer. When you write about your life, stop worrying about
      editors and publishers and agents and about all the readers you hope to reach. It's a privilege
      to write for one other person. Do it with gratitude and with pleasure." (Great ending)

* Messages on my machine (chap 1)
  * "The act of writing told me what my piece was 'about'"
    * "I didn't set out to write about any of those themes... but as I started to write, all those
      other themes came tugging at my sleeve."
  * "Writers are the custodians of memory, and memories have a way of dying with their owner. One of
    the saddest sentences I know is 'I wish I had asked my mother about that.'"
  * "Beware of deciding in advance how your memoir or your family history will be organized and what
    it will say."
  * "Think small"
    * "Write about small, self-contained incidents that are still vivid in your memory. If you
      remember them it's because they contain a larger truth that your readers will recognize in
      their own lives. Think small and you'll wind up finding the big themes in your family saga."
  * "To write well about your life you only have to be true to yourself. If you make an honest
    transaction with your remembered experiences and emotions you'll reach the readers you want to
    reach."
* Writing about school (chap 2)
  * "Specific detail is the foundation of nonfiction writing, and nowhere is it more important than
    in a memoir. You must enable us to picture the place where you grew up and the people who
    crossed your life. But mere recollection isn't good enough ('our house was on Spruce Street').
    The facts must make a point."
    * And the act of writing will produce facts you had long forgotten about.
    * "In a lifetime of travels no city has called me back as often as Rome."
  * "Notice that my piece is not finally about a school; it's about people. In much of your memoir
    writing you will want to recall an institution that was important to you: a school, a church, a
    business, a volunteer organization. But institutions and places have no life of their own. You
    must bring them to life with men and women and children."
    * With rare exception, like when writing about some natural wonder.
    * "Look for the human connection as you make your journey. Connect us to the people who connected
      with you."
  * "Get your unities straight before you start"
    * "My memoir has unity of point of view. It's told from the perspective of the boy
      I was at Deerfield, not the grown-up I was when I wrote it."
  * Zoom out of the story to acknowledge the impact that the event had on you later.
    * "But don't stay out in the future too long. The best memoirs are frozen in a particular time
      and place and social or historical condition."
* The larger world (chap 3)
  * "Always be on the lookout for narrative. Tell stories whenever you can. People love to be told
    stories."
  * "Look for small anecdotes in the larger canvas of life. They will help you to reduce to human
    scale the big events you've been caught up in."
  * "The invasion of Normandy was a mammoth event, involving vast numbers of people. My story reduces
    it to one 21-year-old soldier in Algiers."
    * Waiting for deployment, watching the allied forces cover the map of France.
  * "The only stories I ever wrote about the war are the two I've briefly retold here: one about a
    train ride across North Africa, the other about a summer in Florence. Neither is about the war
    itself. They are stories about how the war changed *me*."
  * "Your biggest stories will often have less to do with their subject than with their
    significance: not what you did in a certain situation, but how that situation affected you."
* A sense of enjoyment (chap 4)
  * Convey a sense of enjoyment
    * "Given a choice between two projects -- one that you feel you ought to write and one that
      sounds like fun -- go for the one you'll enjoy working on. It will show in your writing. The
      reader should always think that the writer is feeling good."
* Writing about places (chap 5)
  * On travel writing, "My pleasure is to make a narrative arrangement of those details that will tell the reader
    something he or she didn't know before -- something interesting or amusing. But they also have
    to be details that interest or amuse *me*. Mere observing and reporting isn't enough. You must
    make a personal connection with the place you're writing about."
  * "Ultimately, it's people -- memorable people -- who make certain places stick in our minds
    forever. Look for those people, wherever you go, and tell us how their story intersected with
    your life."
* People along the way (chap 6)
  * "What I'm always looking for as a writer is someone like Win Min Than who will make a particular
    place come alive."
  * On a manager's art of delay: "I often knew Cornish to solve a complaint by waiting for the
    complainant to resign or retire or even die."
  * While visiting Tahiti, "I mention the aliveness of Hall and Stevenson to remind you not to
    overlook the dead when you travel as a writer in search of interesting people. They are often
    strongly present in the place where they lived."
* The users of memory (chap 7)
  * (Great chapter; a lovely vignette of his passion for baseball, and writing a book about it).
  * Tell the reader how you came into this hobby
    * "Your subject is the transaction between yourself and fishing -- as a sport, as a pastime, as
      therapy, as a buddy experience, as a solitary experience"
  * He scoped his book down to be about one part of baseball -- spring training -- and just one team
    and one town.
    * "There, all my reducing decisions put me in a situation that exactly suited my needs. The
      scale of my book was small and manageable, almost intimate."
  * "Almost every family wants -- and deserves -- to have some kind of record left behind of its
    effort to be a family. If your sister has a problem with your version of the story, she can
    write her own version. Each will have its own integrity. The integrity of the product should be
    your goal."
* An academic life (chap 8)
  * On being invited as a guest lecturer at universities: "What I've learned is not to be fooled by
    the efficiency of the original phone call inviting me to give a talk. Once the speaker is safely
    hooked, little thought goes into what he will need when he eventually shows up."
    * Poor finicky lodging on campus, unlit lecterns, local professors who don't know their way
      around and deliver him late.
  * "I now make it my business to supervise all kinds of details that shouldn't have to be my
    business. I telephone the college in advance to discuss the lectern."
  * Finding his voice in his how-to book On Writing Well. "Make yourself and your experiences
    available."
    * "Readers don't feel that they're hearing from a professor of rhetoric; they're haring from
      another working writer."
  * "Only when I began to write as a teacher and had no agenda except to be helpful -- to pass along
    what I knew -- did my style become integrated with my personality and my character. Now,
    whatever I write about, I make myself available. No hiding."
* Books of the month (chap 9)
  * On a company losing its soul to MBAs
    * "By 1987 the Book-of-the-Month Club had run out of interesting things for me to do. It had
      increasingly become the creature of its corporate owners; sober M.B.A.'s from Time, Inc., buzzed
      through the halls with 30-day plans and 90-day plans and five-year plans and exhortations to 'grow'
      the company. I don't remember hearing them talk about books."
  * "What I took away from the Book-of-the-Month Club was a belief that the best books -- the most
    enduring books and the most useful books -- are written out of some inner core of conviction."
* How to write a memoir (chap 10)
  * Mere facts are not enough; it must be a story
    * "Although nobody's life makes any sense, if you're going to make a book out of it you might as
      well make it into a story. I remember saying to my wife, 'I am now going upstairs to invent the
      story of my life.'"
  * "You must, in short, practice a craft. You can never forget the storyteller's ancient rules of
    maintaining tension and momentum -- rules you've known in your bones since you were a child
    listening to bedtime stories."
  * He suggests preparing a memoir by writing up a memorable event from your life once a day. Not in
    chronological order, but instead, by what's most prominent. During your off time, your
    subconscious will work to further flesh out the memory and its meaning.
    * "All of us who write need a certain amount of time, often quite a lot of time, to relax and
      find our natural voice. Therefore you'll notice that the entries you wrote in the second month
      are warmer than the ones you wrote in the first month, which are a little wooden, a little
      impersonal, a little pretentious."
  * "All writing is talking to someone else on paper. Talk like yourself."
* Writing as a ministry (chap 11)
  * Writing as a ministry, rather than writing to condemn, deplore.
    * "I always write to affirm -- or, if I start negatively, deploring some situation or trend that
      strikes me as injurious, my goal is to arrive at a constructive point."
    * "I choose to write about people whose values I respect and who do life-affirming work; my
      pleasure is to bear witness to their lives. Much of my writing has taken the form of a
      pilgrimage: to sacred places that represent the best of America, to musicians and other
      artists who represent the best of their art."
  * "Most people are on some kind of pilgrimage, whether or not they recognize it as such. If you
    put your writing in the form of a quest you will make a connection with your readers that will
    surprise you with its power."
* Recovering the past (chap 12)
  * A lovely chapter about a early mechanical baseball game for kids
    * "The game gave itself to those who took time to get in tune with its soul."
  * "The lesson for writers in my correspondence with Mrs. Armstrong is that universal themes often
    come cloaked in unlikely garb. Not many people owned a mechanical baseball game; that's a highly
    specialized subject for a writer. But everyone had a favorite childhood toy or game, still
    vividly remembered. The fact that I had such a game, and that it was brought back to me at the
    other end of my life, can't help making a connection with readers who would like to hold *their*
    childhood toy one more time."
  * "Moral: write about things that are important to you, not about what you think readers will want
    to read, or editors will want to publish or agents will want to sell. Readers and editors and
    agents don't know what they want until they read it. If it's important to you, it will be
    important to other people."
    * "I like to write about America, and I like my writing to be situated in a particular place."
  * "To feel the intimacy of brothers is a marvelous thing in life. To feel the love of people who
    we love is a fire that feeds our life. But to feel the affection that comes from those whom we
    do not know, from those unknown to us, who are watching over our sleep and our solitude, over
    our dangers and our weaknesses -- that is something still greater and more beautiful because it
    widens out the boundaries of our being, and unites all living things."
    * Neruda, on feeling the kindness of strangers.
* Change is a tonic (chap 13)
  * One of his commencement addresses. About separating from the current chapter and opening the next:
    * "There are two ways to think about separation: as a loss, or as a beginning. To separate is to
      start fresh. For you, I hope today will be the first of many separations that will mean
      putting behind you something you've done well and beginning something you'll do just as well,
      or better."
    * "Separate yourself from cynics and from peddlers of despair. Don't let anyone tell you it
      won't work."
  * "Bad writing is tired and predictable; nobody wants a cautious writer. When you write, call on
    the best of your character. And make sure you're living the life you want to live."
  * "'If you feel a certain emotion while you're playing the piano', he kept assuring me, 'your
    listeners will feel it, too.'" -- "I give the same advice to writers."
  * "When I sometimes feel a twinge of disappointment if the crowd at one of my gigs is smaller than
    I expected, I hear Mitchell saying, 'It's a privilege to play for one other person.' That credo
    has helped me through many thin situations, both as a public pianist and as a public speaker.
    I've stopped worrying about conditions that I can't control or change. I just do what I came to
    do, as well as I can."
  * "That's also all you can do as a writer. When you write about your life, stop worrying about
    editors and publishers and agents and about all the readers you hope to reach. It's a privilege
    to write for one other person. Do it with gratitude and with pleasure." (Great ending)
