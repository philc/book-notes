  * "Dating exposes us to a far wider range of people than we generally encounter when we exist
    within the protection of a couple. It throws us into the wide sea of humanity and our encounters
    may lead us to a large and sobering conclusion: that human beings can be really strange."
  * "To awaken the dormant faculty of the imagination, we might more regularly -- perhaps in the
    street or on the train to work -- look at the faces around us, especially the less distinguished
    or obviously sculpted ones, and ask ourselves what there could be to delight in. There is always
    going to be something, for we were all once love-worthy children and remain as much in our
    depths."

* Existentialism and dating (chap 2)
  * "In the dating period, ew are closer to a grander and more visceral truth: that there is no
    single script." There's a large fan of possibilities.
* The best chat-up lines (chap 3)
  * Things to tell ourselves, rather than focusing on pick up lines to tell others.
    * "A rejection won't have to be a rejection of the whole of us."
      * "It won't be that they loathe us profoundly or are sickened by our very existence, but rather
        that they are perhaps already with someone else, or are in need of some time by themsevles
        after a harsh break-up, or have physical tastes that run quite innocently in a different
        direction."
    * "People may be a lot less closed off than they seem"
      * "There is often more space in others' hearts than the surface may suggest. We know from our
        own experience how much, despite an often busy and competent life, we maintain an appetite
        for novelty, for new kinds of interaction and sincerity, for fresh sources of kindness and
        interest. We know how open we might at points be to an approach from a self-aware and
        well-meaning stranger."
      * "It isn't impossible that someone we like the look of could, at the very same time as us,
        quietly harbor a hungry heart."
    * "We will soon enough be stone cold dead and should use the idea of our own (more or less)
      impending doom to make us less scared of the many petty challenges that stand in the way of
      our plans for happiness."
* How to prove attractive to someone on a date (chap 4)
  * Dating is a psychological affair, not one of physical attraction or showmanship.
    * "What we're really primed to be stirred by are signs that someone is going to be a dcent
      companion twenty years from now."
  * Someone who can reasonably talk about their flaws: "it is deeply reassuring to witness
    vulnerability well-worn."
  * "What really counts is not whether or not someone is psychologically complicated, but how they
    relate to this complexity: the degree of insight, calm, perspective and humor they can bring to
    bear upon it."
  * Does the person really believe they're easy to live with? "Conversely, there should be nothing
    more terrifying on a date than a person who stick sa little too aggressively to the idea that
    they are totally sane and entirely normal."
  * Ask our partners how they are a bit mad -- "what are your character flaws?"
  * "What really endears us to others is evidence that they share in some of the very difficulties
    and confusions that we are beset by at our core."
    * Rather than to be perceived as always winning. (But isn't there a balance here between
      projecting warm (through vulnerability) vs. strength?)
  * Handling one's own stupidity with grace and good humor: "we are signaling that we know that
    what matters isn't simply the errors we make but how we explain and frame them to those around
    us."
* What to talk about? (chap 5)
  * "What was difficult in your childhood?"
  * "What do you look for in a very close friend?"
  * "What do you fear people might say about you behind your back?"
  * "What are you prone to being addicted to?"
* What to wear? (chap 6)
  * What outfits are really about are "What little essay do we want to write about ourselves in the
    language of garments?"
  * What most people are seeking: "a judicious balance between an appreciation of the charms of
    luxury and a wise and sane respect for the value of economy." Also, whimsy.
* Common oddities we meet when dating (chap 7)
  * "Dating exposes us to a far wider range of people than we generally encounter when we exist
    within the protection of a couple. It throws us into the wide sea of humanity and our encounters
    may lead us to a large and sobering conclusion: that human beings can be really strange."
  * "Rather than complain about how awful most of our dates turn out to be, we should get interested
    in understanding -- and even sympathizing with -- the varieties of human brokenness."
  * "People who "rant" about a problem in the world
    * "Our discomfort in their company arises from the intensity and relentlessness of their manner."
    * "When we come across their ardent views, it isn't that we want to hear less; it's rather that
      we would ideally want to hear more, but in another direction, inwards rather than further into
      sociocultural and economic abstractions."
  * For a cool person, who's always unflustered and impermeable, "there won't be much for our
    affection to hold on to."
* Why the first kiss may be the best sex we ever have (chap 8)
  * "This gratitude is likely to be most prevalent not when one has been granted full license by
    someone, but when one is on the borderline, when one has only just been lent a pass -- and when
    the memory of the taboo of touching others is still intense: in other words, on an early
    successful date. The reminder of the danger of rejection brings the wonder at being included
    into sharp, ecstatic relief."
* Should we play it cool when we like someone? (chap 9)
  * About the "strongly vulnerable" type:
    * "They can tell us of their immense desire for us while simultaneously leaving us under the
      impression that they could fully survive a frank rejection."
  * About dependence
    * "What is off-putting is never inf act that someone likes us; what is frightening is that they
      seem in danger of having no options other than us, of not being able to survive without us."
* Two reasons why we may be single (chap 10)
  * "After having been alone for a long time, we may also have lost the knack of spotting what
    peculiar, demanding and compulsive people we are. With no one to hold up a mirror, we have
    forgotten to give due weight to the rage, the anxiety and the moments of vindictiveness."
  * "To awaken the dormant faculty of the imagination, we might more regularly -- perhaps in the
    street or on the train to work -- look at the faces around us, especially the less distinguished
    or obviously sculpted ones, and ask ourselves what there could be to delight in. There is always
    going to be something, for we were all once love-worthy children and remain as much in our
    depths."
* Dating too little (chap 12)
  * "We cannot choose wisely when remaining single feels unbearable. We have to be utterly at peace
    with the prospect of solitude in order to have any chance of forming a good relationship."
  * "The difficulty of dating is the price we're quietly paying for eventually avoiding divorce."
