* Light (chap 1)
  * "Living lights." They're everywhere -- in every room.
  * "There is one serious drawback to being crazy about candles: the soot. Studies show that lighting just one
    candle fills the air with more microparticles than traffic in a busy street."
  * Sunsets, wood flames, and candlelight are 1800K.
  * Hygge is used to combat the long, dark winters of Denmark.
  * Iconic Danish lamp design all hide the harsh bulb and cast diffused light.
  * The "golden hour" is the first and last hour of the day, where light travels through the most atmosphere
    and produces warm, diffuse, soft light.
  * "Many lamps; small caves of light around the room."
* We need to talk about hygge (chap 2)
  * What might also be unique for Denmark when it comes to hygge is how much we talk about it, focus on it,
    and consider it as a defining feature of our cultural identity and an integral part of the national DNA."
  * The opposite of hygge is creepy, scary.
  * Social element of hygge:
    * Harmony. "It's not a competition. We already like you. There is no need to brag about your
      achievements."
    * Shelter: "this is your tribe. This is a place of security."
* Togetherness (chap 3)
  * Connection and relationships are what deliver happiness. So create an atmosphere and work-life style that
    facilitates warm connections.
  * Equality, group.
    * "It is more hyggeligt if we all help to prepare food, instead of having the host alone in the kitchen."
* Food and drink (chap 4)
  * Danes eat more sweets than every other country in the world, except Finland.
  * Slow food
    * "The longer it takes to cook, the more hyggelig it is."
  * "Having a pot simmering on the stove while you are reading a book in your hyggekrog is not only the sound
    of hygge but the essence of hygge."
* Clothing (chap 5)
  * Scarves: worn by most men and women. The bigger the better.
* Home (chap 6)
  * More so than bars and restaurants, "Danes tend to put a lot of effort and money into making
    their homes hyggelige. They enjoy the most living space per capita in all of Europe."
  * A hyggekrog: a nook. A place in the house to retreat to and curl up.
  * Things made out of wood are hygge: warm, simple, close to nature.
* Hygge all year round (chap 8)
  * Feb: "the best part of a ski trip is the post-skiing hygge."
* Hygge on the cheap (chap 9)
  * "Hygge is humble and slow. It is choosing rustic over new, simple over posh and ambiance over excitement.
    In many ways, hygge might be the Danish cousin to slow and simple living."
  * "It is wearing your pajamas and watching Lord of the Rings the day before Christmas, it is sitting in your
    window watching the weather while sipping your favorite tea, and it is looking into the bonfire on summer
    solstice surrounded by your friends and family while your twistbread slowly bakes."
* Christmas (chap 11)
  * If you think about it, achieving hygge is an explicit goal for the whole month of the advent season.
  * Having warm traditions is hygge.
    * Advent calendar
    * Advent candle
  * "demonstrations of power are not welcome in hygge. In Denmark, Christmas hygge is egalitarian. It is about
    relations and community, not individuals trying to draw attention to themselves. It is not possible to
    achieve hygge if anybody feels excluded or superior to anybody else."
* Summer hygge (chap 12)
  * "It is reading in teh shadow of a tree, enjoying the long summer nights, and standing around the barbecue
    with your friends."
  * Enjoying the warmth of the sun and nature, and connection with friends.
  * Picnics by the beach
    * Bread and cheese
    * Enjoying the freedom of not having to do anything. There are no pressing engagements when you are at the
      beach.
* The five dimensions of hygge (chap 13)
  * The state of hygge: familiar and comforting foods, not too "fresh" or "alternative".
  * The sound of hygge: the quiet absence of sound, plus the quiet noises given off by the environment.
    * The sounds of a person drawing, cooking, or knitting could be hyggelig. Any sound of a safe environment
      will be the soundtrack of hygge."
  * Smells
    * "One common element of all the smells of hygge is that they remind us of safety and the sense of being
      cared for."
  * What does hygge feel like?
    * Smaller, older, handmade things.
    * "The feeling of being inside something warm in a place where it is cold is very different from just
      being warm. It gives the feeling of being comfortable in a hostile environment." Yes -- it's the
      contrast.
* Hygge and happiness (chap 14)
  * The author (who researches happiness) believes Danes are happy because of 1) the welfare state, and 2)
    abundant, deep social connections. Hygge contributes to developing meaningful connections.
  * Savoring good food and gratitude, and being thanful for it, are hygge.
  * "Research also shows that grateful people tend to recover more quickly from trauma and suffering than
    others and are less likely to get stressed in different situations."
  * "Hygge may function as a driver for happiness on an everyday basis. Hygge gives us the language, teh
    objective, and the methods for planning and preserving happiness -- and for getting a little bit of it
    every day."
  * "Happiness consists more ins mall conveniences or pleasures that occur every day, than in great pieces of
    good fortune that happen but seldom."
    * Managing for happiness each day, with teh samllt hings, rather than each decade, with the big moments.
