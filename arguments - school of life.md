* Gems
  * "We can come to see the domestic sphere for what it really is: a superficially trivial arena in
    which we meet, in disguised form, the most important themes of psychology -- the tension between
    the longing for freedom and the fear of entrapment, the horror of constraint and the desire for
    protection, the risks of rigidity and the anxiety of chaos."
* A catalog of different types of arguments, what they mean, and their causes.
* Intro
  * "Beneath the surface of almost every argument lies a forlorn attempt by two people to get the
    other to see, acknowledge and respond to their emotional reality and sense of justice. Beyond
    the invective is a longing that our partner should witness, understand and endorse some crucial
    element of our own experience."
* The interminable argument
  * "I feel you don't respect my intelligence."
    * From this springs sensitivity to differences in judgment.
* The domestic argument
  * "When conflict does occur, it is handled impatiently, with a certainty that it shouldn't be
    occurring and a determination to end it as soon as possible. Unconvinced of the legitimacy of
    our domestic disagreements, we end up bullying and nagging on the one side, and shirking and
    waving away complaints on the other."
  * "We refuse to take our complaints seriously, and so our arguments end up scrappy, lazy and
    oblique."
  * "We can come to see the domestic sphere for what it really is: a superficially trivial arena in
    which we meet, in disguised form, the most important themes of psychology -- the tension between
    the longing for freedom and the fear of entrapment, the horror of constraint and the desire for
    protection, the risks of rigidity and the anxiety of chaos."
* The defensive argument
  * "People don't change when they are gruffly told what's wrong with them; they change when they
    feel sufficiently supported to undertake the change they (almost always) already know is due. It
    isn't enough to be sometimes right in relationships; we need to be generous enough in giving out
    signs of love in order that our partner can admit when they are in the wrong."
    * (This applies for children also)
* The spoiling argument
  * In which we spoil the mood of a bubbly spouse.
  * When you're feeling negative: "A dark instinct in our minds experiences their upbeat mood as a
    warning that the uncheery parts of ourselves must now be unwelcome."
  * How to interpret the actions of the negative person: "They are, through their remorseless
    negativity, in a garbled and maddening way, begging us for reassurance."
* The escalation argument
  * We might term such disputes 'escalation arguments', where a discussion about topic X swiftly
    unleashes an only tenuously related but much larger accusation around Y, which the recipient
    dismisses as having been incorrectly introduced."
  * "The person making the accelerated vindictive remark looks like they are being disproportionate
    and seems at fault for suddenly turning up the heat, but a dangerous wall of steam has been
    building up for which both parties are arguably responsible."
    * Past areas of tension had not been adequately dealt with and flushed.
  * "The accuser is moving swiftly and directly to the core of an issue that should have been
    covered long ago. The escalated argument is signaling some unfinished business."
    * (Even if the timing is inconvenient and inappropriate).
* The eve-of-journey argument
  * Why does one spouse fight with the other on the eve of a departure?
    * "What's happening is that our yearning for love is meeting with a dark, intimate dread: that
      we are deeply dependent on a lover who we don't control, whose affection is out of our command
      and who is about to be taken away from us for a long time."
* The absentee argument
  * To soothe ourselves from the other disappointments in life, "we reroute all the humiliation and
    rage that one else had time for onto the shoulders of the one person who cares most about our
    well-being."
  * (Despite what the author says, this sounds to me like a really crummy argument type, with no
    real redeeming quality behind it).
* The argument of normality
  * This is resorting to "majority opinion."
  * "When it comes to personal life, we have no sound idea of what is normal, because we have no
    easy access to the intimate truths of others."
  * "We should cease cynically lauding the idea of the normal when it suits us by acknowledging that
    almost everything that is beautiful and worth appreciating in our relationship is deeply
    un-normal."
  * "We should stop badgering our partners with phony democratic arguments and admit to something
    far truer and possibly more effective in its honest vulnerability: that we would love for
    something to happen because, and only because, it would make us very happy if it did -- and very
    upset if it didn't."
* The argument from excessive logic
  * "The deployment of an overly logical stance may come across not as an act of kindness, but as a
    species of disguised impatience."
    * Analyzing the partner's reaction rather than empathizing with them.
  * "It could be that the application of excessive logic isn't an accident or form of stupidity. It
    might be an act of revenge. Perhaps the partner is giving brief logical answers to our worries
    because their efforts to be sympathetic towards us in the past have gone nowhere."
