* Gems
  * Limit your inputs.
    * Beware taking in too much information from colleagues, news, and even books.
    * We drown in information, and it comes at a large opportunity cost.
  * Choose virtue
    * "When we're going into a tough assignment, we can say to ourselves over and over again, 'Strength and
    courage.' Before a tough conversation with a significant other: 'patience and kindness.' In times of
    corruption and evil: 'goodness and honesty'."
  * Lust is a destroyer of pace in our lives.
    * "is this not at odds with the self-mastery we say we want? A person enslaved to their urges is not free
    -- whether they are a plumber or the president."

* Intro
  * "The struggle is great, the task divine -- to gain mastery, freedom, happiness, and tranquility." -
    Epictetus
  * "To Seneca and to his fellow adherents of Stoic philosophy, if a person could develop peace within
    themselves -- if they could achieve apatheia, as they called it -- then the whole world could be at war,
    and hey could still think well, work well, and be well."
  * Most religions and philosophies venerate an inner peace.
  * (His definition of stillness sounds compelling, but what is it, precisely? It's described by many factors,
    and as being all-encompassing -- everything depends on it -- "it is the key").
  * "This book is an attempt to answer the pressing question of our time: if the quiet moments are the best
    moments, and if so many wise, virtuous people have sung their praises, why are they so rare?"
* The domain of the mind (chap 1)
  * (Covering Kennedy's urban missile crisis)
  * On Kennedy working through the insanity of the Cuban Missile Crisis, "the Daoists would say that he had
    stilled the muddied water in his mind until he could see through it."
  * To achieve good outcomes in stressful scenarios requires calm, open-mindedness, empathy, and clarity of
    goal. It requires deep thinking of how the end game will play it.
* Become present (chap 2)
  * Marina Abramovic's art exhibit, where she sat in a chair for 79 days and stared at the visitors to her
    exhibit.
  * Being present: caring about the other person and the experience you're sharing.
  * "Even during a quiet evening at home, all we're thinking about is the list of improvements that need to be
    made." (this is striving -- is this bad? I guess it can displace being present)
  * "Endless activities"
    * "We sign up for endless activities and obligations, chase money and accomplishments, all with the naive
      belief that at the end of it will be happiness."
  * "The less energy we waste regretting the past or worrying about the future, the more energy we will have
    for what's in front of us."
  * "You can't do your best if your mind is elsewhere."
* Limit your inputs (chap 3)
  * (I like this chapter. He's describing how to achieve depth).
  * "A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention." - Herbert Simon
  * Napoleon reportedly delayed opening his mail by 3 weeks, to cull the issues that had resolved themselves
    in that time.
    * In the same vein, "don't consume news in real-time."
  * "Each of us has access to more information than we could ever reasonably use. We tell ourselves that it's
    part of our job, that we have to be 'on top of things,' and so we give up precious time to news, reports,
    meetings, and other forms of feedback."
    * This extra information doesn't make one effective.
  * One's expertise should be in timeless things, not the facts of the moment
    * Being an expert in timeless matters makes you wise and interesting
    * "Not only does [news] cost us our peace of mind, but there's a serious opportunity cost too. If we were
      stiller, more confident, had the longer view, what truly meaningful subject could we dedicate our mental
      energy to?"
  * Books can be another route to drowning in information.
  * Eisenhower: he directed his staff to be "a mile deep on what mattered rather than an inch deep on too many
    things."
  * As a boss, know what to not think about. What to ignore and not do. It's your first and most important
    job.
    * Meditations: "Ask yourself at every moment, 'is this necessary?'"
  * Limiting inputs means "pushing away selfish people who bring needless drama into our lives. It means
    studying the world more philosophically -- that is, with a long-term perspective -- rather than following
    events second by second."
  * "The way you feel when you awake early in the morning and your mind is fresh and as yet unsoiled by the
    noise of the outside world -- that's space worth protecting."
  * Set up barriers and chutes to funnel less important work to others.
  * "How different would the world look if people spent as much time listening to their conscience as they did
    to chattering broadcasts? If they could respond to the calls of their convictions as quickly as we answer
    the dings and rings of technology in our pockets?"
* Empty the mind (chap 4)
  * The void: where you become empty and begin to build conviction to act, rather than fretting and
    over-analyzing.
  * Empty your mind, especially before and during performances, to remove your distracting anxieties, and
    second guessing yourself.
* Slow down, think deeply (chap 5)
  * Sit and think quietly about what you want, and how to get there. Almost no one does this.
  * Anne frank user her journal for therapy: "Paper has more patience than people."
  * Seneca: "When darkness had fallen and his wife had gone to sleep, he explained to a friend, 'I examine my
    entire day and go back over what I've done and said, hiding nothing from myself, passing nothing by.' Then
    he would go to bed, finding that 'the sleep which follows this self-examination was particularly sweet.
    Anyone who reads him today can feel him reaching for stillness in these nightly writings."
  * Journaling
    * This is a "weapon of spiritual combat"
    * "Take note of insights you've heard. Take the time to feel wisdom flow through your fingertips and onto
      the page."
    * "This is what the best journals look like. They aren't for the reader. They are for the writer. To slow
      the mind down. To wage peace with oneself."
    * Ask yourself tough questions. "What is the harder choice I'm avoiding? Do I rule my fears, or do they
      rule me? How will today's difficulties reveal my character?"
    * Journaling is an activity that epitomizes quiet time and stillness. It demands and creates stillness.
    * "Instead of carrying that baggage around in our heads or hearts, we put it down on paper. Instead of
      letting racing thoughts run unchecked or leaving half-baked assumptions unquestioned, we force ourselves
      to write and examine them. Putting your own thinking down on paper lets you see it from a distance. It
      gives you objectivity that is so often missing when anxiety and fears and frustrations flood your mind."
    * "Journaling is spiritual windshield wipers."
* Cultivating silence (chap 6)
  * Silence is rare and beautiful; seek it.
  * It doesn't have to be quiet. Just absent of voices.
* Seek wisdom (chap 7)
  * "Imperturbable" -- calm, unable to be excited. This is an admirable trait.
  * Socratic method: the unbiased, earnest pursuit of truth.
  * "Examine oneself each day."
  * "Tolstoy expressed his exasperation at people who didn't read deeply and regularly: 'I cannot understand
    how some people can live without communicating with the wisest people who ever lived on earth.'"
  * "The wise are still because they have seen it all. They know what to expect because they've been through
    so much. They've made mistakes and learned from them."
    * So put yourself in unfamiliar situations and live through them to gain wisdom.
* Find confidence, avoid ego (chap 8)
  * Earned confidence is the still middle ground between ego and imposter syndrome.
  * "Observers often commented on Grant's unshakable confidence in battle. )when other generals were convinced
    that defeat was imminent, Grant never was. He knew he just needed to stay the course. He also knew that
    losing hope -- or his cool -- was unlikely to help anything.
  * The nature of a confident person is not to harbor any self-doubt, nor require validation or recognition
    from others. This allows for faulty opinions to be swapped out for current opinions, once the truth is
    learned; without hesitation.
  * Don't feed insecurity. Don't feed delusions of grandeur. Both are obstacles to stillness.
* Let go (chap 9)
  * Achieve stillness by giving up chasing. Let go of the outcome. Detach. Focus on and find gratification in
    the steps, not the outcome.
  * Students focused on topping the class: "they are difficult to teach and easily discouraged when the
    journey proves harder than expected. They are not present. They are not open to experience and cannot
    learn."
  * On archery mastery: "this is the balance we want to strike: if we aim for the trophy in life -- bet it
    recognition or wealth or power -- we'll miss the target. If we aim too intensely for the target --as Kenzo
    warned his students -- we will neglect the process and the art required to hit it. What we should be doing
    is practicing. What we should be doing is pushing away that willful will.
* The domain of the soul (chap 10)
  * Example in chapter: Tiger Woods' scandal
  * "Everybody's got a hungry heart -- that's true. But how we choose to feed that heart matters. It's what
    determines the kind of person we end up being, what kind of trouble we'll get into, and whether we'll ever
    be full, whether we'll ever really be still."
  * For Tiger, there was stillness only on the golf course -- everywhere else, he was at the mercy of his
    appetites.
    * "In one sense, his father's training had succeeded. Tiger Woods was mentally tough. He was cold-blooded
      and talented. But in every other part of his life, he was weak and fragile -- bankrupt and unbalanced."
    * "As he worked to crowd out distractions -- anything that would get in the way of his concentration
      addressing each shot -- he was also crowding out so many other essential elements of life: an open
      heart. Meaningful relationships. Selflessness. Moderation. A sense of right and wrong." These are
      sources of stillness.
* Choose virtue (chap 11)
  * Virtue is "moral and civic excellence." Pure rightness.
  * Principles expedite one's decision making
    * "No one is more exhausted than the person who, because they lack a moral code, must belabor every
      decision and consider every temptation."
  * "When we're going into a tough assignment, we can say to ourselves over and over again, 'Strength and
    courage.' Before a tough conversation with a significant other: 'patience and kindness.' In times of
    corruption and evil: 'goodness and honesty'."
  * Leveraging the asset of the character that you have built: "when everyone else is scared and tempted, we
    will be virtuous, and we will be still."
* Beware desire (chap 13)
  * Lust is a destroyer of pace in our lives.
    * "is this not at odds with the self-mastery we say we want? A person enslaved to their urges is not free
    -- whether they are a plumber or the president."
  * "Consider the inevitable hangover before you take a drink." Doing so will dampen your appetite.
  * Athanasius wrote to create the feeling that others are watching him.
    * "By observing and then writing about his own behavior, he was able to hold himself accountable and make
      himself better."
  * "Only those of us who take the time to explore, to question, to extrapolate the consequences of our
    desires have an opportunity to overcome them and to stop regrets before they start."
* Enough (chap 14)
  * The word "enough" is a beautiful thing. It represents the state of feeling satisfied.
    * (But doesn't "feeling satisfied" kill your drive? "I'm never satisfied.")
    * Never having "enough" drives us to achieve, but also prevents us from enjoying and being satisfied with
      what we ultimately earn.
  * "When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you." - Lao Tzu
  * "We hurry on anyway, and attend to our business because we need to matter, and we don't always realize we
    already do."
  * Careful not to let an accomplishment (super bowl ring) displace your love for the process (training for
    and playing football).
  * Be driven, but do it from a good place. You already have abundant accomplishment; go further because you
    like to -- without insecurity and anxiety, and from a still place.
* Bathe in beauty (chap 15)
  * Centering: "nature was a kind of cure-all, a comfort available to any and all who suffer." (Anne Frank)
  * In simply noticing, we become alive, and connected go God.
  * "The poet's eye" -- the ability to see beauty everywhere, even in the mundane.
  * "A floor filled with a child's toys, arranged in the chaos of exhausted enjoyment. A city arranged the
    same way, the accumulation of hundreds of years of spasmodic, independent development."
  * The Japanese have a concept called "forest bathing", which is a form of soothing therapy. Go be in the
    woods!
* Accept a higher power (chap 16)
  * Believing in some form of higher power allows you to stop fighting for control in situations where you
    can't, like when facing slavery or death. This helps you achieve stillness.
  * "The progress of science and technology is essential. But for many of us moderns, it has come at the cost
    of losing the capacity for awe and for acknowledging forces beyond our comprehension. It has deprived us
    of the ability to access spiritual stillness and piety."
  * "Are we really to say that a simple peasant who piously believed in God, who worshipped daily in a
    beautiful cathedral that must have seemed a wondrous glory to the greatness of the Holy Spirit, was worse
    off than us because he or she lacked our technology or an understanding of evolution? If we told a Zen
    Buddhist from Japan in the twelfth century that in the future everyone could count on greater wealth and
    longer lives but that in most cases those gifts would be followed by a feeling of utter purposelessness
    and dissatisfaction, do you think they would want to trade places with us?" This doesn't sound like
    progress.
  * "Try to look at this moment in the light of eternity."
  * Common among people who persevered through adversity: "They believed in an unfailing hand rested on the
      wheel, and that there was some deeper purpose or meaning behind their suffering even if they couldn't
      understand it."
  * No matter what you think of evidence, faith and belief are powerful forces.
  * "This is about rejecting the tyranny of our intellect, and our immediate observational experience, and
    accepting something bigger, something beyond ourselves."
* Enter relationships (chap 17)
  * "There is no enjoying the possession of anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with." -
    Seneca
  * "It is true that relationships take time. They also expose and distract us, cause pain, and cost money. We
    are also nothing without them."
  * "A solitary existence is terribly misguided." People trade relationships for self-sufficiency, or extreme
    dedication to their calling.
  * "Who is there who would wish to be surrounded by all the riches in the world and enjoy every abundance in
    life and yet not love or be loved by anyone?" - Cicero.
  * Connection requires surrender -- a willingness to be part of a greater whole.
  * Relationships and responsibility enhance every career, rather than starve it. Anything else is a myth.
  * "The notion that isolation, that total self-driven focus, will get you to a supreme state of enlightenment
    is not only incorrect, it misses the obvious: Who will even care that you did all that? Your house might
    be quieter without kids and it might be easier to work longer hours without someone waiting for you at the
    dinner table, but it is a hollow quiet and an empty ease."
  * "Stillness is for other people."
* "Conquer your anger" (chap 18)
  * Love, gratitude, and purpose are cleaner fuel for success than anger.
  * On Michael Jordan's use of anger: "Could it have actually been a parasitic by-product that prevented him
    from enjoying what he accomplished? (Tom Brady wins a lot without being mean or angry.)"
  * Success via anger tends to prevent you from enjoying it along the way.
  * Believes people who are driven by anger are not happy, nor still.
* All is one (chap 19)
  * The Greeks on the dependence between people: "they believes that each person on this planet had an
    important role to play."
  * Mitfreude -- the active wishing of goodwill to other people (vs. schadenfreude)
  * Everyone feels similar feelings as you about something
    * "no one is alone, in suffering or in joy. Down the street, across the ocean, in another language,
      someone else is experiencing nearly the exact same thing. It has always been and always will be thus."
    * "You can even use this to connect more deeply with yourself and your own life. The moon you're looking
      at tonight is the same moon you looked at as a scared young boy or girl, it's the same you'll look at
      when you're older -- in moments of joy and in pain -- and it's the same that your children will look at
      in their own moment sand their own lives."
* The domain of the body (chap 20)
  * "Around noon he'd stop in to say hello to his wife for the first time --believing all his life that the
    secret to a happy marriage was that spouses should not see each other before noon." (Churchill)
  * Churchill took up bricklaying and oil painting as hobbies to shift his mind away from his over-stressed
    primary faculties.
  * "Life does that to us. It kicks our ass. Everything we work for can be taken away."
      * How do you handle the stress of the whiplash? Love the discipline you know and let it support you.
  * Churchill himself would write that every prophet must be forced into the wilderness --where they undergo
    solitude, deprivation, reflection, and meditation. It's from this physical ordeal he said that "psychic
    dynamite" is made. When Churchill was recalled, he was ready. He was rested. He could see what no one else
    could or would. Everyone else cowered in fear of Hitler, but Churchill did not."
* Say no (chap 21)
  * The many ways in which we must learn to say no:
    * No, I'm not available
    * No, that sounds great but I'd rather not
    * No, I'm going to wait and see
    * No, I don't like that idea
    * No, I don't need that -- I'm going to make due with what I have
    * No, because if I said yes to you, I would have to say yes to everyone
  * "Always think about what you're really being asked to give. Because the answer is often a piece of your
    life, usually in exchange for something you don't even want. Remember, that's what time is. It's your
    life, it's your flesh and blood, that you can never get back."
* Take a walk (chap 22)
  * "When Martin Luther King Jr. was a seminary student at Crozer, he took an hour walk each day through the
    campus woods to 'commune with nature'."
  * Walking is a deliberate exercise in peace.
  * Be present; get lost; go slowly; be unreachable.
  * "Walk away from the thoughts that need to be walked away from."
  * "This isn't about burning calories or getting your heart rate up. On the contrary, it's not about
    anything. It is instead just a manifestation, an embodiment of the concepts of presence, of detachment, of
    emptying th emind, of noticing and appreciating the beauty of the world around you."
* Build a routine (chap 23)
  * Routine is useful to order the world and provide a platform for reliable excellence.
  * "Routine, done for long enough and done sincerely enough, becomes more than routine. It becomes ritual --
    it becomes sanctified and holy."
  * About sports players, "the greats know that complete freedom is a nightmare."
  * Routine can be one's writing utensils laid out before sitting down to write.
  * "To one person, taking care of a horse is a chore. To Simon Bolivar it was a sacred, essential part of his
    day. When the body is busy with the familiar, the mind can relax. The monotony becomes muscle memory."
  * Make a routine to defend against the day's chaos.
    * "Needless to say, this is exhausting. It is a whirlwind of conflicting impulses, incentives,
      inclinations, and external interruptions. It is no path to stillness and hardly a way to get the best
      out of yourself."
  * Automate good and virtuous decisions by putting them into your routine. Like only putting healthy food
    around the house.
* Get rid of your stuff (chap 24)
  * "One of Seneca's most powerful metaphors is the slave owner owned by his slaves, or the wealthy man whose
    vast estates lord over him rather than the other way around."
    * Signing up for increased responsibility because of the complexity of your life or your possessions can
      decrease rather than increase your enjoyment of life.
  * "When he saw a child drinking water from a well with his hands, Diogenes smashed his own cup, realizing
    that he had been carrying around an extraneous possession."
  * "We become tied down by what we own."
  * (John Boyd) "If a man can reduce his needs to zero, he is truly free: there is nothing that can be taken
    from him and nothing anyone can do to hurt him."
  * "No one dogged by creditors is free." Live within your means.
  * Dependency on things gives your enemies a vulnerability.
  * The "catastrophe of success" is the way that we become less able to do things ourselves, with time.
  * "The more we own, the more we oversee, the less room we have to move and, ironically, the less still we
    become."
    * Does this apply to the number of projects -- at home, in the workplace, open source, hobbies -- that I
      feel responsibility for and maintain? Have these become the masters of my attention? Too much
      responsibility limiting the potency of my current pursuit.
  * "Don't use money to purchase status anxiety."
    * We find sly ways to mention our possessions in conversation. This is unflattering behavior.
* Seek solitude (chap 25)
  * "A crowded world thinks that aloneness is always loneliness and that to seek it is perversion." - John
    Graves
  * "Solitude is the school of genius." It is in the shower or on hikes where we come up with our insights and
    realizations.
  * Gates think weks: 7 days alone in a cabin in a forest. When he emerges, he's able to see farther into the
    distance.
  * "Everywhere I have sought peace and not found it, except in a corner with a book." (Thomas a Kempis)
  * "Our responsibilities will be better off for our temporary experience" because we will carry back with us
    some stillness, gratitude, patience, and insight.
* Be a human being (chap 26)
  * Used the example of Queen Victoria and Albert - don't overwork, burnout, and die.
  * "This is the key. The body that each of us has was a gift. Don't work it to death. Don't burn it out.
    Protect the gift."
* Go to sleep (chap 27)
  * 'People say, "I'll sleep when I'm dead," as they hasten that very death.'
  * Churchill thought that the siesta had life-giving powers.
* Find a hobby (chap 28)
  * William Gladstone, prime minister of England, had tree-cutting with an axe as a hobby, to clear his mind
    and become absorbed in something consuming and repetitive.
  * "Leisure historically meant simply freedom from the work needed to survive, freedom *for* intellectual or
    creative pursuits. It was learning and study and the pursuit of higher things."
  * "William Osler, the founder of Johns Hopkins University, told aspiring medical students that when
    chemistry or anatomy distressed their soul, 'week peace in the great pacifier, Shakespeare."
  * For leisure, "what is absent is any external justification -- you can't do leisure for pay, you can't do
    it to impress people." Leisure is not absent of action -- it's just absent of justification.
  * Meditative peace from trying to conquer the limits of the physical body:
    * "The repetition of a long swim, the challenge of lifting weights, the breathlessness of a sprint --
      there is a cleansing experience, even if it is accompanied by suffering."
  * "Sitting alone with a canvas? A book club? A whole afternoon for cycling? Chopping down trees? Who has the
    time? If Churchill had the time, if Gladstone had the time, you have the time."
  * The ideal Renaissance man is active, busy, fulfilled, and balanced.
