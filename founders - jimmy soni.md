* Intro
  * "During its first two years of existence, PayPal cycled through three CEOs, and its senior management team
    threatened to resign en masse -- twice."
  * "Just over two years passed between the X.com-Confinity merger and PayPal's initial public offering on the
    Nasdaq, but many employees felt as though they'd worked a lifetime."
  * "Several said they did their life's finest work during this period."
    * Unforgivingly intense, and remembered with pride and fondness.
  * Ecology of talent: Bell Labs, Google, Florence.
    * "As he looked into these revolutionaries, he discovered them to be products of 'very fertile scenes
      involving lots and lots of people --some of them artists, some of them collectors, some of them curators,
      thinkers, theorists... all sorts of people weho created a kind of ecology of talent."
    * "Scenius" instead of solo genius.
* Building blocks (chap 1)
  * Levchin learned programming as a kid in the Ukfraine helping his mom detect radiation in food. Emigrated
    to Chicago when he was 16 to; Ukraine was hostile to Jews. Very little money.
  * Did UIUC undergrand. Hallmark intensity.
    * "Levchin soon became consumsed by the world wide web and found networks and forums full of kindred
      digital spirits."
  * Marc Andreessen was from UIUC; he did Mosiac while there and then started Netsacpe.
  * "One thing that really shaped me -- and probably a lot of other people at Illinois --was this constant
    sense of opportunity in the air because Mosaic and subsequently Netscape." - Levchin
* The pitch (chap 2)
  * Thiel: Stanford undergra,d law grad. Launched Stanford Review newspaper as a student.
  * Started a hedge fund after law school.
  * Levchin and Thiel hiring so many technical, high-IQ people at PayPal:
    * "So maybe it was groupthink, but for a small group of people to achieve something and achieve it really
      fast, it was actually, in hindsight, a masterful thing to do."
* The right questions (chap 3)
  * "Musk transferred from Queen's to the University of Pennsylvania nad pursued dual degrees in physics and
    finance."
  * "Musk admitted to studying business as a hedge. 'I was concerned that if I didn't study business, I would
    be forced to work for someone who did study business."
  * Musk loved video games and built them as a kid.
  * "From where he sat, the brains behind Yahoo and Amazon were just a few years older than him and surely no
    wiser. But starting his own venture still felt risky, particularly with a Stanford graduate school
    acceptance in hand."
  * Musk: go through with the Stanford graduate program, or join the tech boom?
    * "I would spend several years watching the internet go through this incredibly rapid grwoth phase and that
      would be really difficult to handle -- so I really wanted to be doing something."
  * Started a company called Global Link with his brother and got $3.5M VC in a few months. How is that
    possible?
    * "Musk slept at the office and showered at a nearby YMCA."
  * Zip2, Musk's first company, provided local listing sand maps to newspaper websites and media companies. He
    wanted to compete directly with Yahoo but his colleagues had lower ambitions. He was changed from CEO to
    CTO because he was too abrasive to his coworkers. In Feb 1999, sold the company to Compaq (who owned
    Altavista) for $300M cash! Age 27.
* What matters to me is winning (chap 4)
  * "his first imperssion of Musk 'Very high energy,' Payne remembered. 'Very much let's go, let's get going
    and do something, build something, achieve something.'"
  * Musk's home: "'The room was literally filled with books -- biographies or sotires about business
    luminaries and how they succeeded,' Payne said, 'In fact, I remember sitting there and at the top of this
    stack was a book about Richard Branson. It kind of clicked to me that Elon was prepping himself and
    studying to be a famous entrepreneur.'"
  * His email address: e@x.com
  * Musk didn't want VC because he wanted full control, and self-funded much of x.com initially.
  * X.com wanted to be an internet bank but regulatory work was slow and high-overhead.
  * Musk: "You start off with an idea, and that idea is mostly wrong. And then you adapt that idea and keep
    refining it and you listen to criticism. And then engage in sort of a recursive self-improvement... keep
    iterating on a loop that says,, 'Am I doing something useful for other people?' Because that's what a
    company is supposed to do."
    * "too much precision in early plans, he believed, cut that iterate loop prematurely."
  * Musk fired his cofounder (a finance guy) and the other one (product guy) left also as a result.
  * "Two decades later, Musk offered only brief reflections on the early chaos at X.com, calling it 'a hot
    minute' in PayPal's history. 'There's always drama in start-ups,' he said."
* The beamers (chap 5)
  * On Thiel taking the CEO position at Confinity
    * "He had no interests in a CEO's administrative and managerial duties -- he preferred sticking to markets
      and money."
    * "Thiel could also see the value in operating experienc e-- time in the CEo chair could fine-tune his
      investor antannae."
  * "There were downsides to [their hiring] approach, too, of course. Hiring friends risked a cloistered,
    exclusionary monoculture and made it excpetionally hard to let people go."
  * Thiel: "friends-turned-employees came preinstalled with trust. Trust produced speed."
  * "Brilliance, nonconformity, availability, and the willing suspension of disbelief --these qualities
    defined Confinity's first hires and formed the foundation of its culture."
    * (Availability... spare bandwidth in their lives. Because no one was successful yet.)
  * Their initial focus -- beaming money around via Palm Pilot's -- was all wrong. They iterated on their
    idea, the pitch, the extrapolation of their market... how much energy did they spend on that stuff? Was it
    worthwhile? Contrasted agianst something so clear and correct, like Google's vision.
  * 100 pitches to SV venture firms, all failed. Finally landed $4.5M from Nokia, who wanted to maket a bet on
    mobile payments.
  * "They told Buhl that Levchin was the 'real deal.' 'In a way', said Buhl, 'the real insurance policy was
    how incredible Max was by reputation.'"
* Hosed (chap 6)
  * Ironic: "Throughout the spring and early summer of 1999, Confinity and X.com occupied adjoining office
    suites at 394 University Avenue in Palo Alto."
  * The opinion Confinity developed about the value of PR: "It was much more important for recruiting and for
    perception among investors than it is about actual product adoption."
  * On choosing a catchy name: "If people don't konw how to say something, or if they are fearful of saying it
    incorrectly, they will do anything to avoid saying it. Embarrassment is a very strong emotion."
  * Levchin on pitching your startup against Google: "To win, you need to tell a story about cogs. At Google,
    you're a cog. Whereas with me, you're an instrumental piece of this great thing that we'll build together.
    Articulate the vision."
  * "Max kept repeating, 'As hire As. Bs hire Cs. So the first B you hire takes the whole company down.'"
  * The Palm Pilot beaming transaction didn't even settle until it was later docked to a desktop. How did they
    think this idea was viable?
  * Max, about things like the selection of the core programming language: "Anyone that did want to argue
    about it wouldn't have fit in. Arguing would have impeded progress."
  * Balancing belocity versus groupthink
    * "A good rule of thumb is that diversity of opinion is essential anytime you don't know anything about
      something important. But if there's a strong sense of what's right already, don't argue about it." - Max
  * Chad Hurley, future founder of YouTube, joined as a graphic designer out of college.
  * They stumbled upon using their website to allow users to email money, to satisfy the use case when they
    forgot their Palm Pilots.
  * When Sacks invterviewed by invite of Thiel, he was unafraid to trash the product during his interview.
