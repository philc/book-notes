* Gems
  * "The premise that your child is good will inform how you interpret tough behaviors and stuck
    moments. Rather than responding with threats or punishments, you can see your child as a small
    person with good intentions, figuring out a big world. You have an opportunity to understand,
    set limits, and guide."
  * "If kids are controlled by fear and judgement, they aren't challenged to develop their own moral
    compass. They don't build an internal sense of good that carries them through the moments when
    no one is watching."
  * "If you can hear and understand your child in her most vulnerable, challenging states, this
    unconditional love builds a sense of trust and safety that she will carry with her forever."
  * Parents "continue to try and cut off feelings quickly, correct right away, or coax their kids
    into being happy again", rather than saying that their feelings are OK and safe to have.
  * "It feels like an assault to us, a failure on our part, or even a manipulation. But the very
    moment when your child is being as unappealing and unhinged as she can possibly be is the moment
    when she's signaling that she needs you the most."
  * Natural consequences
    * Arbitrary punishments like "no screen time" do little to teach.
    * "The world will deliver its own natural consequences -- don't be afraid to let these happen.
      When consequences are logical and make sense for the situation, they're helpful learning tools
      and we should not shield our kids from experiencing them."
    * Kids develop this with natural consequences: "the sense of optimism that comes from knowing
      you can affect your environment and that you have control over your life. This feeling of
      control is highly linked to greater well-being."
  * Calm down instead of time-out
    * Time out implements isolation and shaming. The kid ends up resenting the parent and the
      sibling they were hurting.
    * "Calm down": separation, but with you present as a team. After it's done, "please check in
      with your sister."
  * Argues that if a parent is completely absent during the conflict between siblings, it's a missed
    opportunity. The parent doesn't need to control the conflict, but they can lay down scaffolding,
    naming what they see, prompting each person to express themselves, offering frameworks which
    should be helpful. (Sounds like a therapist).
  * Instead of "I don't want to hear anymore fighting" say "Do you guys need some help figuring
    things out?"
  * On games before sleep:
    * "An interactive game or another screen-based activity requires kids to be engaged, make
      decisions, receive rewards or not, advance to the next level or not -- all of which keeps the
      brain awake, releases stress hormones, and makes it harder to disengage and fall asleep."
  * The downsides of playing an engaging video game
    * "When it's over, other activities can seem less interesting and enjoyable. Stress hormones
      that raged during the epic dragon battle still course through the body. Sometimes video games
      can leave kids feeling mentally depleted and emotionally dysregulated. This can appear as a
      child being withdrawn, bored, or tantrum-prone."
  * Explain your thinking behind why you've banned a piece of content:
    * "This isn't a show we watch, because it doesn't have any information in it."
    * "This isn't a show we watch, because it's too fast and overwhelming to our minds."
    * "We only watch one hour of TV each day so we can leave room in the day and in our minds for
      everything else: running, building, talking, playing -- we have to keep space for those
      things."
  * "Kids need unstructured time playing in the physical world. When they don't have it, they feel
    less regulated and peaceful."
    * Screen time displaces the time they have for this.
* Intro
  * "[Parents] often feel like drill sergeants, issuing no's, yelling, and time-outing."
  * "Your child is capable and built for good"
    * On raising unruly, entitled kids: "Whichever camp they're in, though, most parents tell us
      that something is missing. When they're very strict, they end up feeling guilty and worry
      they're missing a deeper connection to their kids. When they try to empathize and be flexible,
      they often feel ineffective and resentful."
* Three steps for communicating in difficult moments (chap 1)
  * "Win-win": being able to parent with these qualities which are at odds with each other
    * Warmth vs. high-expectations
    * Empathy vs. clear limits
    * Kind vs. consistent
  * Parental breakdown: "A mom with endless warmth who cannot hold limits and feels walked all over
    by her kids."
  * ALP method: Attune -> Limit set -> Problem solve
  * Your child is "built for good" -- naturally wired to be empathetic and learn from experience.
  * "The premise that your child is good will inform how you interpret tough behaviors and stuck
    moments. Rather than responding with threats or punishments, you can see your child as a small
    person with good intentions, figuring out a big world. You have an opportunity to understand,
    set limits, and guide."
  * Unhelpful view: "kids need tough love. That's what makes a good parent." More helpful and
    accurate: "how we treat our children affects how they treat everyone else."
  * Kids might be disobeying at bedtime, but it may be because they've missed mom and want to
    connect with her, and don't know how to show it. Attuning to this need will meet their needs
    better than a threat of "no story time!"
    * "I see silly people running all over the place here. Hey, everyone, urgent cuddle 911! I've
      missed you guys so much today. I'm excited to see what happens in the next chapter of that
      book we started last night. So teeth and then meet me on the couch!"
  * The author uses the analogy "tip of the iceberg"
    * If they're not listening, that's the final output of what is probably a set of underlying
      causes, which might include: needs contact; tired/hungry; overscheduled; in a new environment;
      overstimulated; feeling inferior; sad/angry.
    * "Instead of butting heads over the behaviors at the tip of the iceberg, you address them from
      the bottom up. Now you're connected, and your words are more effective."
  * The adult's responsibility is to ask "what is underneath this annoying behavior?" Difficult
    behavior is an opportunity to attune.
  * Emotions sometimes come in intense spells -- storms -- this is to be expected, and they always
    pass.
  * Let it be OK when your kid has emotions, rather than feeling as if you have to fix difficult
    emotions. Be a safe bedrock.
    * "Emotions are okay. They come and go, they aren't forever or scary. I'm here with you no
      matter what and I'm okay with all your feelings."
  * "If kids are controlled by fear and judgement, they aren't challenged to develop their own moral
    compass. They don't build an internal sense of good that carries them through the moments when
    no one is watching."
  * Rewards will lower intrinsic motivation and teach that the behavior being rewarded is
    distasteful on its own. So, the behavior will not persist in the long run when the reward is
    absent.
  * Shaming, bribing, threats: "If children are capable and built for good, none of these tactics
    are necessary. They all imply that a child needs to be tricked or forced to do the right thing."
  * "At the end of the day, we all yearn for connection. We want our trusted people to see and
    understand us, especially in vulnerable moments."
  * If a parent can develop the skill of attunement, their kids will keep coming to confide in them
    even as they get older.
  * Attuning is:
    * Pausing rather than reacting with your own feelings first
    * Listening and watching with genuine curiosity
    * Communicating that you understand or you're trying to understand
    * Creating the experience of feeling seen and heard
  * "Leading with understanding side steps power struggles."
    * "I'm with you. I'm here to guide and help you. We're in this together."
  * How to attune
    * Pause: attune by pausing before you react. "Harder than it sounds."
      * Respond with "Hmm, let's think about this."
    * Use your body language
      * Make them feel safe and open. Standing over your child is an offensive move. Being at eye
        level is a collaborative move.
    * Say what you see: the sportscaster
      * Use an observant and curious tone, not blaming. Helps them remain open while seeing cause
        and effect.
    * Paraphrase what you've just heard from them; be a "good waiter".
      * This validates their experience.
  * "Try not to insert or project your own feelings, but see his behavior as understandable, given
    his development level."
    * They don't yet know what's trivial vs. important.
  * When placing limits, they should be paired with explanation. This helps the child extrapolate to
    future scenarios.
    * Attune: "You want those cookies from this grocery store huh? I know they look good."
    * Limit set: "we're not buying that today because we're just getting what we need for our meals."
  * "As kids get older, if you have consistently held reasonable limits without caving or
    flip-flopping, they will internalize these lessons and their testing of them will naturally
    decrease."
  * Problem solving
    * "The gist of the problem-solving step is 'here's what you *can* do!'"
    * "When things don't go their way, optimists feel a sense of agency to overcome, rather than the
      pessimist's tendency to blame outside forces for their problems."
    * The "head-scratching, bumbling parent": create space for them to come alongside and propose
      the obvious solution.
    * The "follow-through" choice: an escape hatch where the parent can take control of the
      situation
      * "Can you lead us out of the store? (Pause) It seems like it's hard to leave. You can walk
        yourself or I will carry you."
    * Calm down instead of time-out
      * Time out implements isolation and shaming. The kid ends up resenting the parent and the
        sibling they were hurting.
      * "Calm down": separation, but with you present as a team. After it's done, "please check in
        with your sister."
      * "Mom: whoa, okay I saw that. That was too rough. Come and sit with me for a few minutes to
        calm down. You're showing me you need a break to regroup. I'm going to help you take a
        breather."
  * Repair and circle back
    * Some ruptures are routine, like getting mildly frustrated. Some are toxic, like screaming or
      insulting.
    * "Repair is when we help our kids make sense of what happened. It brings us back together and
      kids get the sense that we're still 'with' them, even if something difficult happened. Repair
      is part of how babies and children build trust -- they see that even when people disagree and
      become disconnected, they come back together again."
      * This also applies to parental fights in front of kids.
    * "Kids notice and register our words and reactions all the time. If they feel a rupture, they
      log it and it stays with them. If they can't make sense out of why it happened, the memory can
      be stored in a way that compromises their future relationships. It's like a piece of the
      puzzle is missing."
    * Model humility by repairing. Messing up is an opportunity for good.
  * "Parenting is made up of thousands of small moments that together tell a story that can be
    beautiful and meaningful."
* Proactive tools (chap 2)
  * Attitude as a parent, facing the emotional turbulence of young children: "We don't know what
    today will be like, but let's see. We're in it together!"
  * Family meetings
    * "The tone of family meetings is positive, can-do-together, rather than scolding or negative."
      * (I'm realizing that I make my family meetings rushed, like the meeting isn't capable of
        holding my kids' attention span, and this naturally undermines their value and makes them
        feel of less consequence.)
    * Mix fun updates, like vacations, with more exhausting topics, like problems and rules.
    * Convert complaining into productive requests
      * "As you know, in family meetings we say what we do want, not what we don't want. Make a
        clear statement to your sister about what your idea or request is."
    * Recommended cadence: once a week or once a month.
    * Present new information to your kids together. "Of course, I have to check in with Mom. We're
      a team."
  * Working as a parenting team
    * Criticizing the other parent's parenting offline is more respectful than doing it online, and
      it allows the other parent to cool down and be ready to receive it.
    * "Parents miss and long for those simple shows of affection they remember from their early days
      as a couple."
    * Working through conflict in a mature way in front of the kids provides a positive model for
      them.
    * Debriefing a parental argument to the kids: "We had big feels and I know our voices must have
      been loud. Each of us had really different ideas and we got upset. Finally we did figure out
      how to hear each other, though."
  * The preparation step: proactively reviewing the family's rules of conduct, in context. E.g. the
    rules of eating at restaurants while on the way to a restaurant.
    * "I've got the bath running. Everyone lay out your clothes and pack your backpacks for tomorrow
      before hopping in."
  * Moving kids along
    * "We're heading out in five minutes -- everyone do your last thing!"
      * (This sounds better, and more positive, than "Five minute warning -- there's not much time
        left!")
    * "We're almost at school -- does everyone know what to do when I park?"
  * Filling the tank
    * Sleep deprivation triggers bad behavior. Kids don't appear tired, but rather hyper-active.
    * "Toddlers need eleven to twelve hours of nighttime sleep, plus a nap. School-age children
      still need ten to twelve hours of nighttime sleep."
    * Snacks should be the same healthy composition as meals. "Mini-meal."
    * "If it's been about three hours or more since the last meal or snack, hunger may be the cause
      of difficult behavior. Avoid offering food as a way to soothe, distract, or as a bribe, as
      this can lead to emotional eating."
    * Movement: creativity increases after a walk; take a walk yourself as you problem solve a
      parenting situation.
  * Overscheduling
    * Parent-directed life: kids "end up being led around by a grown-up all day: to school, child
      care, sports, errands, music, ballet, homework, chores, dinner, and bedtime. They don't feel
      in control of their lives. It doesn't leave breathing room to let moments unfold
      spontaneously."
    * Kids can't easily identify or express that they're over-scheduled.
    * "We're taking a break from soccer this round, so we can keep open afternoons for just seeing
      what happens."
  * Parties: "leave while you're still having fun."
    * Kids get over-stimulated at parties and events.
    * "Decide ahead of time when it would make sense to leave an event, and do your best to stick to
      it. There will be times when you're sacrificing an hour of fun, but if everyone feels
      balanced, you can look forward to your next outing instead of dreading the aftermath."
  * Teach your kids that meals are a communal family experience. Don't introduce electronics.
  * Child-led play
    * Their natural interests are very important for their development. Your role is to tune in and
      follow.
    * "Be aware of not talking constantly. Nonverbal communication and silence lets your child be
      the one to take the lead."
    * It's a good "space to be in", where you consciously let go of all those adult worries that
      don't actually matter as much as connecting with your kid.
      * Being present with your kids during child-led play requires the same discipline as
        meditation. The mind naturally wanders. Playing with a child without distraction is like
        meditative exercise.
    * Don't overhelp. Give kids the thrill of overcoming challenges.
    * Ask the child to tell you "all about" something she's interested in or currently working on.
      Let hear be the teacher. This is empowering and connecting.
  * Self-care for the parent
    * Self-talk
      * You're flooded; how to relieve your emotions, so you can talk to your kids with kindness and
        grace?
      * Self-talk: "it's my job to stay calm and be the bigger person."
      * "I'm not a bad parent. I'm having normal feelings."
      * I need to take space for a few minutes. Let's talk about this after that. I need to sort
        this out in my mind.
    * "Sleep changes everything" and is the fountain of patience.
      * Try sleeping 30 minutes more per night, so your tank is slightly overflowing rather than
        slightly under-filled.
  * "If you can hear and understand your child in her most vulnerable, challenging states, this
    unconditional love builds a sense of trust and safety that she will carry with her forever."
    * (This breaks my heart. In many such moments I've expressed consequences and judgments, rather
      than unconditional love.)
  * Mindfulness exercises
    * "The more present we are, the more our children trust us and the more securely attached they
      become -- this helps them grow naturally more independent over time."
    * Pick some mindfulness thing you can actually do -- not another commitment that you will feel
      bad about if you miss it each day.
    * Try observing your child: stop what you're doing, listen, and take in your baby or child.
      * (I do this often, and liken it to watching goldfish in a tank. It's relaxing and
        gratitude-inducing.)
  * "Sometimes they just need to know you see them, even without words, or with a simple *I saw
    that!*"
* Difficult feeling and tantrums (chap 3)
  * Parents "continue to try and cut off feelings quickly, correct right away, or coax their kids
    into being happy again", rather than saying that their feelings are OK and safe to have.
  * Treat negative feelings and tantrums as rare opportunities to show that you care and you "get"
    what they're feeling. This helps them feel attached and to become resilient.
  * "It feels like an assault to us, a failure on our part, or even a manipulation. But the very
    moment when your child is being as unappealing and unhinged as she can possibly be is the moment
    when she's signaling that she needs you the most."
  * A more accurate and helpful word for tantrum is "emotional flood."
  * Instead of saying "it's OK" (which is dismissive of the child's feelings), try "that looked like
    it hurt. Let me see that arm" or "I'm here with you."
  * Home vs. school behavior
    * "School is a place to hold it together -- home is a place to work things out."
    * Home is safe, where they can fully express themselves.
  * Let feelings be feelings: "you are not in control of everything your child does, nor do we want
    our kids to feel pressured to always be happy."
  * "Don't confuse attuning with overtalking, indulging, letting unacceptable behaviors go, or
    changing your limit. You can hold a limit and problem solve, all the while validating your
    child's experience."
  * Attunement tools
    * Tool: pause
      * "Pause and let the crying or yelling be okay for a second. Imagine the waves moving your
        boat and let that be fine."
    * Tool: I'm going to kindly move you
      * "It's a caring and kind practice to follow as a parent, to move your child to a private spot
        (the car, another room, the sidewalk, etc.) when she's having a hard time. This avoids shame
        and embarrassment while giving you a chance to talk somewhere private."
        * Rather than public reprimand.
      * Letting feelings run their course: "I see how upset you are. I'm here when you're ready to
        talk or make a choice."
    * Why not ignore a tantrum, or punish with a time-out?
      * "When kids are having a hard time (even when it seems totally irrational), they're telling
        us they need us. Ignoring them, punishing them, or giving a time-out is the opposite of
        this. It makes them feel isolated, cut off, and shamed."
      * Rather than a time-out, consider a "calm down huddle."
      * "Some kids are soothed by physical touch -- hugging will help them regroup and calm down. If
        your child is one of these, you might even put your arms out and ask, 'I see. Can I give you
        a hug?'"
      * Isn't this rewarding misbehavior? "She needs connection, teaching, or calm time. Punishing
        doesn't accomplish any of that. As long as you're holding the limit, you're not being 'too
        soft' and your child will learn that you're on her side."
      * "The key with... all tantrums is to be resolute in holding the limit. THat way, you don't
        ever have to get mad or reactive; you simply stay strong and accept the big feelings. A
        kids' job is to test limits. Your kids will learn that when you set a limit, you hold it.
        Over time, you'll see how valuable this is."
    * Tool: tell me more
      * "I'm scared of my room." -> "What's scaring you about it?" rather than shutting them down.
      * "Tell me more" allows the child to open up.
    * About meltdowns: "Your child slams the door furiously and won't speak -- this is not the time
      to talk about the rules, teach, or explain. Information is not going to be received or
      integrated. In this mode, your child's emotional brain has overwhelmed him and the logical
      thinking brain is not in charge."
      * (Well said)
  * Limit set
    * Reacting to disrespectful or hateful words
      * Rather than getting upset, say "it's hard for me to hear your words when you're using that
        voice. It's distracting me from what you're trying to tell me."
      * (If only I could be that stoic)
    * It's OK to change a limit, but be explicit about why.
      * "You know what, I hear what you're saying and I've changed my mind.
      * "This is not snack time. We're leaving some no-food time before dinner, so bellies get
        hungry and we can enjoy our meal."
  * The bumbling parent: "try to adopt a tone of voice that says 'Hmm, let's see. We're in this
    together and we have to figure it out.'"
  * Telling your own story: "you know, something like this happened to me."
* Hitting, pushing, biting, and other physical behaviors (chap 4)
  * Helpful, non-judgmental list of reasons why children may be physically acting out.
    * Sleep deprived
    * Overstimulated
    * Understimulated (bored, lonely)
    * Hungry
    * Trying to connect
    * Frustrated: unable to get needs met
  * The case against spanking
    * "Spanking models the exact behavior you want them to stop."
    * "Spanking creates fear, anger, and shame. This makes kids shut down, so it's impossible for
      them to take in all the nuances and details of life you are trying to teach."
    * "Spanking erodes trust and the sense that you are here to help and guide your kids."
  * The case against time-out
    * They do not spend their time reflecting on their behavior. Instead, they feel isolated,
      shamed, embarrassed, and resentful.
    * It shuns the child who needs understanding from a parent.
    * Alternative: a "calm down" where the parent stays with the child.
  * Attune
    * "If your child hurts someone, he's telling you he needs your help. Use your iceberg analogy
      and think, What's under this behavior? What is he trying to accomplish or figure out?"
  * Checking in
    * "If your child won't say anything or check in with the other person, don't focus too heavily
      on it. You check in for him."
    * "Checking in is not a punishment. If you need to model it for your child dozens of times
      before he picks up on it and starts to do it himself, that's okay."
* Listening, following directions, and engaging cooperation (chap 5)
  * Kids arguing, mom frustrated, demands they stop, "or else":
    * "With their building tension, they were telling her they could use understanding and help. In
      yelling at them, she missed this opening, and the conflict escalated. This is an *offensive*,
      versus *attuned*, move. Offensive moves escalate or intimidate."
  * If you're trying to intimidate or scare your child, their defenses go up.
    * "If you approach with a sense that you are trying to understand and be helpful (not just rush
      and order her around), her defenses are lowered. Now you can work together."
  * Attuned moves: sportscast; disarm them; referee their dispute. "Don't enter the ring yourself.
    That's offensive." "You can still be effective and avoid being a pushover."
  * When we threaten, "it sends the message that you don't believe your child is willing and able to
    do the right thing without fearing a consequence or needing a reward. That's not the path you
    want to go down."
    * E.g. "Okay, you're not putting your shoes on? Then I'm leaving without you."
    * (I feel convicted)
  * Avoid overtalk and overexplaining
  * Examples of engaging cooperation
    * At the dinner table: "should we pretend we're waiters and it's time to clear the table for
      dessert?"
    * "I know you guys are having fun! We're going to leave soon, so do your last thing."
  * Getting them dressed for school
    * "Simply walking over and getting on her level, and maybe touching your child on the shoulder,
      even without words, makes her feel like she's not being shuttled and commanded. When you do
      this, you lower your child's defense. Now she's more receptive to what you have to say."
    * "How would you want your loved one to call you for dinner if you were curled up on the couch
      reading a cliff-hanger or halfway through writing a time-sensitive email?"
  * Bribing
    * A slight reframing is "if this, then that."
    * E.g. "when you've picked out your clothes for tomorrow, let's snuggle up and start reading
      books."
    * This teaches them "goodness naturally follows good behavior."
    * "Resist saying 'If you don't brush your teeth, we won't have time for books,' and try the
      subtly different, 'When your teeth are all brushed, we'll be ready for stories.'"
  * Whining
    * This is softer than a hard shutdown of "stop whining!"
    * "I can tell you're having a hard time. When you say that in a normal or regular voice, I'll be
      ready to listen."
  * Natural consequences
    * Arbitrary punishments like "no screen time" do little to teach.
    * "The world will deliver its own natural consequences -- don't be afraid to let these happen.
      When consequences are logical and make sense for the situation, they're helpful learning tools
      and we should not shield our kids from experiencing them."
    * Kids develop this with natural consequences: "the sense of optimism that comes from knowing
      you can affect your environment and that you have control over your life. This feeling of
      control is highly linked to greater well-being."
  * "As your child gets older and more capable, you help lesa nd less, while he takes over more
    decisions -- even when it means not getting a good grade. This will make him more likely to
    become internally motivated in the future."
  * Follow-through choice
    * "One of your choices in the problem-solving step can be a follow-through choice. This choices
      involves you physically stepping in to enforce the limit. Over time kids learn that they can't
      stall forever and the family will keep moving one way or another. Try to be lighthearted and
      matter-of-fact about it. It's not a punishment, it's just a reality. It's important that you
      are always very gentle and calm."
  * Examples of genuine descriptive praise
    * "You folded your laundry and put away toys. It's such a pleasure to walk into your room. How
      does it feel to you?"
    * "Let's see how sparkly those teeth are!"
    * "I saw you working hard on that. How does it feel to be done?"
* Sibling relationships (chap 6)
  * "We hear moms and dads express not only frustration and helplessness but also profound sadness
    that their kids don't get along. They had envisioned a different kind of family from the one
    emerging in their homes."
  * Some level of conflict between siblings is expected, and healthy -- it allows them to develop
    conflict resolution skills.
  * Positive beliefs about the nature of sibling relationships, meant to serve as an anchor for
    interpreting their conflict:
    * "Siblings know each other their whole lives. There is a depth to that history."
    * "Siblings share a family culture and memories and, of course, a future."
    * "Siblings support and teach each other."
    * "Conflict is always an opportunity to learn something helpful."
  * Argues that if a parent is completely absent during the conflict between siblings, it's a missed
    opportunity. The parent doesn't need to control the conflict, but they can lay down scaffolding,
    naming what they see, prompting each person to express themselves, offering frameworks which
    should be helpful. (Sounds like a therapist).
  * Instead of "I don't want to hear anymore fighting" say "Do you guys need some help figuring
    things out?"
  * "Ask questions that point them toward empathy for the other."
    * "Why do you think he did that?"
    * "He looks sad -- I wonder why. Do you know?"
    * "Tell her how that made you feel."
  * Help them limit set with each other
    * "Name-calling hurts my feelings."
    * "I want to play my own game for a while, then we can play together."
    * "We can't control what other people do. But we can control what we decide to do."
  * "When the other child is not open to resolving the conflict, her choices will include walking
    away, taking a break, and staying calm, even while holding her ground. This nonreactive behavior
    can really defuse these conflicts and kids end up feeling capable and in charge, instead of like
    a victim."
  * Diffusing claims of "not fair" when siblings get different treatment: "You are two different
    people. Different ideas, wants, and needs."
* Screen time (chap 7)
  * Parents should avoid using their phones around kids, because it's distracting and breaks the
    parent's attention towards the child.
  * On games before sleep:
    * "An interactive game or another screen-based activity requires kids to be engaged, make
      decisions, receive rewards or not, advance to the next level or not -- all of which keeps the
      brain awake, releases stress hormones, and makes it harder to disengage and fall asleep."
  * The downsides of playing an engaging video game
    * "When it's over, other activities can seem less interesting and enjoyable. Stress hormones
      that raged during the epic dragon battle still course through the body. Sometimes video games
      can leave kids feeling mentally depleted and emotionally dysregulated. This can appear as a
      child being withdrawn, bored, or tantrum-prone."
    * (This reminds me of eating chocolate chip cookies: afterwards, regular fruit no longer tastes
      interesting).
  * Attune: when they protest as they withdraw from screen time, attuning will help them feel
    understood.
  * Ask, watch, and play: participate with the content so you can relate to your child and their
    interest.
  * "Research suggests that quick edits and disconnected or fast story lines can overload the
    brain's executive function and make it harder for kids to focus and self-regulate. If you find a
    certain program or app loud, annoying, or busy, it's probably not good for little minds."
  * Don't offer a device to soothe
    * "Babies and little kids need connection, eye contact, and physical touch -- this is how they
      develop self-regulation and a secure attachment."
  * "Turning off and putting away electronics and media before you eat supports mindful eating and
    allows the family to talk and connect."
  * Limit background television
    * Research "suggests that kids have a hard time focusing and playing well when television is on
      (even if they're not watching the television)."
  * "Having a space to park devices out of direct eyesight helps symbolically turn them off and
    shift attention to other activities. It makes the boundary between screen time and
    not-screen-time clearer."
    * Phones on the shelf at night, not in bedrooms.
  * Model the behavior you want to see. Phones are powerful for research, TODOs, but pulling one out
    comes with a cost.
  * Consider narrating what you're doing on your device
    * Unlike a book or notepad, a phone doesn't have a clear, narrow focus to the outside observer.
  * Consider setting the rules around screen time together, so that there's more buy-in.
    * Example rule: "We have a list of shows and video games that are okay to watch and play. If we
      want to add something to the list, Mom or Dad has to watch it and see if it's okay to add."
  * Explain your thinking behind why you've banned a piece of content:
    * "This isn't a show we watch, because it doesn't have any information in it."
    * "This isn't a show we watch, because it's too fast and overwhelming to our minds."
    * "We only watch one hour of TV each day so we can leave room in the day and in our minds for
      everything else: running, building, talking, playing -- we have to keep space for those
      things."
  * Ask your child critical questions:
    * "Is this show too intense? It feels really intense to me!"
    * "Can you see how that game is tricking your mind to think you have to keep playing? Games are
      very good at keeping us playing!"
* Bedtime and sleep (chap 8)
  * "Many moms and dads dread this time of the day. Parents tell us all the time how frustrated they
    feel as the evening rolls in and their kids wind up."
  * Sleep should be positioned as a gift, a luxury, a necessity, rather than a punishment or dead
    end of the day.
  * "With sleep on your side, everyone is more creative and patient."
  * Goal: promote a warm, positive climate around bedtime. Messages to send:
    * Connected: know we're nearby (we acknowledge their needs).
    * Capable: we encourage rather than threaten
    * Cozy: the environment is relaxing
  * Creating connection and peace of mind during the day
    * "Get down on eye level to say good-bye, give a hug, and tell your child to keep that hug "in
      your pocket" for during the day when they're thinking of each other."
    * "Snuggle on the couch together, even for ten minutes before bed, and share your highs and lows
      of the day."
  * "Kids need unstructured time playing in the physical world. When they don't have it, they feel
    less regulated and peaceful."
    * Screen time displaces the time they have for this.
  * Wind down time before bed
    * "Put away your phone and computer if you can. This allows you to connect with your kids, which
      in turn makes them more open to moving through the steps of the routine. They've filled up on
      you, so they can now disconnect and fall asleep."
