# School of life - Alain de Botton

## Gems

* The solution to our relationship agitation is pessimism: lower our expectations. "Every human can
  be guaranteed to frustrate, anger, annoy, madden, and disappoint us -- and we will (without any
  malice) do the same to them."
  * The lower the expectations of relationships, sex, work, children, politics, the greater our
    satisfaction in the actual outcomes.
* "In many areas of life, we observe a strange, unexpected phenomenon: a prejudice in favor of
  abstruseness, density, enigma, and the esoteric. Our respect for explanations that come close to
  incomprehensible, that provoke puzzlement, that employ uncommon words suggests an implicit belief
  that the truth should not come in a form that is easily fathomable." (yes, curious)
* Being a "generous onlooker", interpreter
  * Even when they do not know any of the details, generous onlookers must make a stab at picturing
    the overall structure of what might have happened to the wretched being before them. They must
    guess that there will be sorrow and regret beneath the furious rantings, or a sense of
    intolerable vulnerability behind the pomposity and snobbishness. They must intimate that early
    trauma and let-down must have formed the backdrop to later transgressions. They will remember
    that the person before them was once a baby too.
* The "weakness of strength": the theory that weakness-free people do not exist. Each person's
  weakness is the inevitable downside / shadow of one of their strengths. Comfort comes from not
  viewing a person's weaknesses in isolation, but as the necessary cost of enjoying the strengths
  that drew us to them.
  * E.g. messy but creative; driven but self-centered; uncompromising but honest.
  * "It's always an option to move away and find people who will have new kinds of strengths, but
  --as time will reveal -- they will also have new, fascinating, and associated kinds of
  weaknesses."
* True kindness requires uncommon candor in moments
  * "True niceness does not mean seeming nice; it means helping the people we are going to
    disappoint to adjust as best they can to reality. By administering a sharp, clean blow, the
    diplomatic person kills off the torture of hope, accepting the frustration that is likely to
    come their way: the diplomat is kind enough to let themselves sometimes be the target of hate."
* Vulnerability
  * Failure is what makes friends. Not winning. Hearing about the failure, what we're sad about,
    that we're lonely, how we're being embarrassed. It's endearing.
    * (But what about demonstrating strength? Vulnerability, without power, is warm but irrelevant).
  * By being vulnerable, you're offering up the valuable opportunity for others to hurt and
    humiliate you.
    * "Friendship is the dividend of gratitude that flows from an acknowledgment that one has
      offered something very valuable by talking."
* Friendship
  * "Friendships cannot develop until one side takes a risk and shows they are ready to like even
    when there's as yet no evidence that they are liked back."
  * "We should stop worrying quite so much whether or not people like us, and make that far more
    interesting and socially useful move: concentrate on showing that we like them."
* A need to be alone
  * "At a certain point, we have had enough of conversations that take us away from our own thought
    processes, enough of external demands that stop us heeding our inner tremors, enough of the
    pressure for superficial cheerfulness that denies the legitimacy of our latent melancholy -- and
    enough of robust common sense that flattens our peculiarities and less well-charted ideas.
  * Retreating to be alone allows us to be our best selves when we return to fellow humans. Rested,
    processed, full of original opinions.
* The cure for unrequited love is more knowledge, so that they cease to look like the ultimate love
  for us. More knowledge will "set you free."
* Partner-as-child; the "infant model of interpretation"
  * With children, we forgive their obnoxious, hurtful behavior because we don't assign mean
    intentions to kids. We have benevolent explanations for their behavior.
  * Consider doing the same with adults.
    * "It's very touching that we live in a world where we have learned to be so kind to children;
      it would be even nicer if we learned to be a little more generous toward the childlike parts
      of one another."
    * Everyone is generally very good at loving little children. Argues that parts of adults will
      always remain childish, because they're tied to how the person was a a kid. And this is the
      case with all adults.
  * "The problem with adults is that they look misleadingly adult."
* "It was meant to be nicer:" as children we were cherished. In marriage, that tends to wear off
   quickly and our partner isn't all that interested in the details of our lives and feelings. So
   don't judge our marital care against how we were treated as kids.
* Marriage acts as a formal obstacle to make one's impulses less dangerous.
  * "We deliberately invite an elderly aunt or uncle whom we don't even like much to fly around the
    world to be there. We are willingly creating a huge layer of embarrassment were we ever to turn
    round and admit it might have been a mistake."
* (on our culture) "We need to fall silent -- more frequently than we do -- and simply listen."
* Virtual friends, mentors, to give us solace and companionship
  * "Strangely, it appears that certain imaginary friends drawn from culture can end up feeling more
    real and in that sense more present to us than any of our real-life acquaintances, even if they
    have been dead a few centuries and lived on another continent. We can feel honored to count them
    among our best friends." (in the same way that children cling to transitional objects to embody
    and reactivate their memories of parental love when their parents aren't there).
  * "The arts allow us to become the soulmates of people who, despite having been born in 1600 are,
    in limited but crucial ways, our proper companions. The friendship may even be deeper than that
    we could have enjoyed in person, for it is spared all the normal compromises that attend social
    interactions."
  * What an honor, for one deceased, to be counted a s friend among the future generations of the
    living.

## Intro

* Why don't we teach emotional education? It's believed to be unteachable, lying beyond reason, best
  left to instinct and intuition.
* Religion provided emotional education throughout history. If you don't have that, where do you get
  it? "Culture".
* Self-help is a widely discredited genre: garish covers, overblown promises. But this genre is
  working on core problems of self that we need to solve.
* Once we stop growing physically, and when we plateau at work, we still grow emotionally as we age.
  Sometimes dramatically so.
  * "We may, over two sleepless nights, have entirely rethought our attitude to envy or come to an
    important insight about the way we behave when someone compliments us. We may have made a
    momentous step in self-forgiveness or resolved one of the riddles of a romantic relationship."
* Art
  * Prior to romanticism, the point of art was to render tough or knotty lessons easier to absorb;
    to nudge our recalcitrant minds toward accepting ideas that we might nod along to but then
    ignore if they were not stated in especially varnished and graceful terms.
  * Ideas would have to be amplified by art in order to work their way properly into our muffled
    intelligence.
* Ritual
  * To combat the frequent forgetting of important but difficult lessons.
  * Religious use of rituals: "it is they that have created occasions at which to tug our minds back
    to honoring the seasons, remembering the dead, looking inside ourselves, focusing on the passage
    of time, empathizing with strangers, forgiving transgressions, or apologizing for misdeeds. They
    have put dates in our diaries to take our minds back to our most sincere commitments."
  * "The best rituals don't so much impose upon us ideas that we are opposed to but take us back to
    ideas that we are in deep agreement with yet have allowed to lapse: they are an externally
    mandated route to inner authenticity."
* First world problems
  * A fear of being too self-indulgent is counterproductive. "Part of what stops us addressing our
    emotional knots is a background belief that they are too small to be worth bothering with."
* It's a devastating belief to think that it's possible to be completely and enduringly happy.
* "What we can aim for, at best, is consolation -- a word tellingly lacking in glamour. To believe
  in consolation means giving up on cures; it means accepting that life is a hospice rather than a
  hospital, but one we'd like to render as comfortable, and interesting, and as kind as possible."
  (Yeesh. I reject this resigned view.)
* Given the difficulty of life, and the presence of original sin, the best we can hope for is
  salves: understanding and companionship. We're not the only ones experiencing this type of pain.
* In praise of melancholy
  * Melancholy is not rage or bitterness; it is a noble species of sadness that arises when we are
    properly open to the idea that suffering and disappointment are at the heart of human
    experience. It is not a disorder that needs to be cured; it is a tender-hearted, calm,
    dispassionate acknowledgment of how much agony we will inevitably have to travel through.
  * Contrast this with the unrelenting emphasis by society on buoyancy, joy, cheerfulness.
  * The melancholy know that many of the things we most want are in tragic conflict: to feel secure
    and yet to be free; to have money and yet not to have to be beholden to others; to be in
    close-knit communities and yet not to be stifled by the expectations and demands of society; to
    explore the world and yet to put down deep roots; to fulfill the demands of our appetites for
    food, sex, and sloth and yet stay thin, sober, faithful, and fit.
* The simple vs the obscure
  * "In many areas of life, we observe a strange, unexpected phenomenon: a prejudice in favor of
    abstruseness, density, enigma, and the esoteric. Our respect for explanations that come close to
    incomprehensible, that provoke puzzlement, that employ uncommon words suggests an implicit
    belief that the truth should not come in a form that is easily fathomable." (yes, curious)

## Knowing the past (chap 2)

* No one passes through childhood without incurring deep emotional "primal wounds." Our childhoods
  are so long. It's 20 years before we're classified as adults.
* We are deeply shaped by our parents. Kids are impressionable during this period.
  * "We can return to our original home for a holiday when we are parents ourselves and find,
    despite our car, our responsibilities, and our lined faces, that we are eight once more."
  * When we are children, we are without a skin. If a parent shouts at us, the foundations of the
    earth tremble. We can't tell that some of the harsh words weren't perhaps entirely meant, or had
    their origins in a tricky day at work, or were the reverberations of the adult's own childhood.
    It simply feels as if an all-powerful, all-knowing giant has decided, for certain good reasons
    that we are to be annihilated."
* As children, we can't understand that a parent is sometimes not in control of their own destiny.
  Why did they have to move away or travel for work?
* The author argues that any perturbations in childhood cause personality imbalances; fears,
  sensitivities. Not dramatic, but significant.
  * (Is that really true? Aren't we giving too much credit to the environment?)
  * "We make our lives tougher than they should be because we insist on thinking of people,
    ourselves and others, as inept and mean rather than, as is almost invariably the case, primarily
    the victims of what we have all in some ways traveled through: an immensely tricky early
    history." (This feels incomplete and flawed. Searching for that history in others is noble,
    empathetic, but should we really expect to attribute everything to it? No...)
* Greek tragedies: from seemingly minor starting points, terrible consequences unfurl.
* The emotionally helpful childhood
  * (Good, dense section).
  * Whole care from a powerful, generous adult: "They did not, all the while, ask that we thank
    them, understand them, or show them sympathy. They didn't demand that we inquire how their days
    went or how they were sleeping at night."
  * "Self-centeredness has to have a clear run in the early years if it isn't to haunt and ruin the
    later ones."
  * "In an emotionally healthy childhood, we're given the benefit of the doubt. We are assessed by
    what we might one day be, not by exactly what we are right now."
    * Charitable interpretations are frequently offered, along with connecting actions as followup.
  * "Boringly predictable": the relationship with our caregiver is steady, consistent, and
    long-term.
  * The adults know their own flaws and do not expect a child to be fundamentally better than they
    are. We do not have to comply at every turn to be tolerated. We can let others in on our shadow
    sides.
    * Some "moral freedom" -- opportunity to rebel.
  * Career isn't a rival. The adult gets their limelight elsewhere.
  * The good carer isn't overly ambitious on the child's behalf. They want them to do well, but for
    their own sake and in their own way. There is no particular script that the child has to follow
    in order to be loved.
  * In an emotionally healthy childhood, the child learns that things that break can be fixed. Plans
    can go awry, but new ones are made.
  * The child's life isn't manufactured to be perfect, without disappointment.
    * In contrast with bearable disappointment, the child is prompted to create their own internal
      world, in which they can dream, hatch fresh plans, and build up their own resources.
  * The child can see that the good carer isn't either entirely good or wholly bad and so isn't
    worth of either idealization or denigration. The child accepts the faults and virtues of the
    carer with melancholy maturity and gratitude -- and in doing so, by extension, becomes ready to
    accept that everyone they like will be a mixture of the positive and the negative.
    * Carer is a model of the population. Is this realistic, though? Our parents are often
      superheroes to us.
  * Asserts that parents aren't any better today at delivering this emotionally healthy childhood
    than we were for the last hundreds of years.
* The markers of emotional love
  * Self-love
    * In relationships, do we have enough self-love to leave an abusive union?
  * Candor
    * Around others, how ready are we to learn? Do we always need to take a criticism of one part of
      us as an attack on everything about us? How ready are we to listen when valuable lessons come
      in painful guises?
  * Communication
    * Can we have a plausible second go and take seriously the thought that others are not merely
      willfully misunderstanding us? Do we have the inner resources to teach rather than to insist?
  * Trust
    * "Of what material do we feel we are made?" (interesting prompt)
    * Do we, overall, feel the world to be wide, safe, and reasonable enough for us to have a
      legitimate shot at a measure of contentment, or must we settle, resentfully, for
      inauthenticity and misunderstanding?

## Therapy (chap 3)

* (A treatise glorifying the use of therapy as an effective tool. Isn't this too rosy?)
* Psychotherapy is a tool, like a bucket to help you hold water, or a knife to cut.
* In all of our relationships (friends, lover), we keep a barrier between what we say and what is
  really going on in our heads. No one else bears witness to our inner insanity, except therapists.
  That's the one relationship we've constructed where it's OK to do so.
* Therapists do not require us to reciprocate rapport
  * "Like a parent who doesn't need a small child to reciprocate, the therapist voluntarily forgoes
    equality in the relationship; they won't talk of their regrets or insist on their anecdotes.
    They simply want to help us find what is best for us, understood on our terms."
* It's hard to focus. We keep losing the thread. We lose arguments and analysis about emotional
  subjects to the mental sands.
* The therapists most powerful tools: "do say more", "go on."
* Why is therapy spread out over so many months? It's because revealing ourselves and considering
  issues longitudinally is important for getting to solutions. We can't get to the bottom of things
  in a marathon session, without time between for our thoughts to marinate.
* Building self-esteem: "when things don't go as we want, we can ask ourselves what a benevolent
  fair judge would say, and then actively rehearse to ourselves the words of consolation they would
  most likely have offered (we'll tend to know immediately).
* Philosophical meditation: not the Eastern variety of achieving emptiness. Instead, focusing,
  examining, acknowledging our emotions around events.
* Technique: turn over three questions
  * What am I anxious about right now?
  * What am I upset about right now?
    * We are almost invariably carrying around with us pulses of regret, loss, envy, vulnerability,
      and sorrow.
  * What am I ambitious and excited about right now?
    * To face our callings, and envision where they will take us, and how we'll be more fulfilled
      once we face those callings.
* Warning against stoicism and relentlessly "manning up" when faced with trials
  * "We are mental athletes at shrugging such things off, but there is a cost to our stoicism. From
    small humiliations and slights, large blocks of resentment eventually form that render us unable
    to love or trust. What we call depression is in fact sadness and anger that have for too long
    not been paid the attention they deserve."
  * "We might, as we turn over our griefs, large and small, imagine that we are sharing them with an
    extremely kind, patient figure who gives us the chance to evoke hurt in detail, someone with
    whom there is no pressure to rush, be grown up or impressive."
* "A daily period of philosophical meditation does not so much dissolve problems as create an
  occasion during which the mind can order and understand itself. Fears, resentments, and hopes
  become easier to name; we grow less scared of the contents of our own minds -- and less resentful,
  calmer, and clearer about our direction. We start, in flattering steps, to know ourselves slightly
  better."
* The importance of a breakdown
  * "One of the great problems of human beings is that we're far too good at keeping going."
  * The big disruptions in "business as usual" shouldn't be censored and treated as scandalous.
    They're clear indicators that things must change, and death of the thing is preferable to the
    status quo.

## Kindness, meritocracies (chap 4)

* Being a "generous onlooker", interpreter
  * Even when they do not know any of the details, generous onlookers must make a stab at picturing
    the overall structure of what might have happened to the wretched being before them. They must
    guess that there will be sorrow and regret beneath the furious rantings, or a sense of
    intolerable vulnerability behind the pomposity and snobbishness. They must intimate that early
    trauma and let-down must have formed the backdrop to later transgressions. They will remember
    that the person before them was once a baby too.
* All of us can be richly generous in our interpretations, and in giving of sympathy. Unlike
  financial generosity, which is from rich to poor.
* "Losers"
  * In short, beware the overly simplistic implications of a meritocracy.
  * "Our societies are very interested in winners, but don't really know what to do about losers --
  of which there are always, by definition, a far greater number."
  * In a meritocracy, "the status of a person has to be a more or less reliable indicator of their
    effort and decency."
* In a meritocracy, failure is a catastrophe, because it sets your identity.
* The ancient Greeks had a concept for this: the "tragic drama": you could be good and yet fail.
  * "These great fictional characters belonged to a far nobler, more dignified, and more humane
    category that tragedy helped to map: that of the tragic failure, the person who loses without
    thereby forfeiting the right to sympathy and mercy." These characters weren't losers; they
    inspire understanding.
* The "weakness of strength": the theory that weakness-free people do not exist. Each person's
  weakness is the inevitable downside / shadow of one of their strengths. Comfort comes from not
  viewing a person's weaknesses in isolation, but as the necessary cost of enjoying the strengths
  that drew us to them.
  * E.g. messy but creative; driven but self-centered; uncompromising but honest.
  * "It's always an option to move away and find people who will have new kinds of strengths, but
  --as time will reveal -- they will also have new, fascinating, and associated kinds of
  weaknesses."
* What to think about our enemies
  * Contented people have no need to hurt others. As a result, your enemies who hurt you must be
    unwell in some way.
  * Framing the victim as powerful: "We, who have no wish to hurt, are in fact the stronger party;
    we, who have no wish to diminish others, are truly powerful. We can move from helpless victims
    to imaginative witnesses of justice."
* Frankness
  * The frank person spends time spent broadcasting signals of assurance and affirmation.
    * "The frank person assumes that everyone's ego is already at least as big as it should be. They
      are even likely to suspect that if you praise someone for the little things, you'll only
      inflate their self-regard to undue and dangerous proportions."
* Diplomacy
  * "Knowing the intensity of the craving for respect, diplomats -- though they may not always be
    able to agree with others -- take the trouble to show that they have bothered to see how things
    look through foreign eyes."
  * They work on the relationship just as hard as on the issue.
  * True kindness requires uncommon candor in moments
    * "True niceness does not mean seeming nice; it means helping the people we are going to
      disappoint to adjust as best they can to reality. By administering a sharp, clean blow, the
      diplomatic person kills off the torture of hope, accepting the frustration that is likely to
      come their way: the diplomat is kind enough to let themselves sometimes be the target of
      hate."

## Charm (chap 5)

* Shyness
  * This is curable by focusing on the universal identity that we share with everyone. We are not an
    outcast, different, we have something to say and contribute.
  * Local identity vs universal identity
    * Our local identity comprises our age, gender, skin color, sexuality, social background,
      wealth, career, religion, personality type.
    * "Universal identity is made up of what we have in common with every other member of the
      species: we all have problematic families, have been disappointed, have been idiotic, have all
      loved, have all had problems around money, and anxieties -- and will all, when pricked, start
      to bleed."
    * Shylock's universal identity: "I am a jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hat not a Jew hands, organs,
      dimensions, sense, affections, passions? fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,
      subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, armed and cooled by the same winter
      and summer, as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?"
  * Shy people think they're boring: "when we dismiss a person as boring, we are merely pointing to
    someone who has not had the courage or concentration to tell us what it is like to be them. But
    we invariably prove compelling when we succeed in detailing some of what we crave, envy, regret,
    mourn, and dream."
  * The purpose of social intercourse
    * "The person we call interesting is in essence someone alive to what we all deeply want from
      social intercourse: an uncensored glimpse of what life looks like through the eyes of another
      person and reassurance that we are not entirely alone with all that feels most bewildering,
      peculiar, and frightening in us."
* Vulnerability
  * Failure is what makes friends. Not winning. Hearing about the failure, what we're sad about,
    that we're lonely, how we're being embarrassed. It's endearing.
    * (But what about demonstrating strength? Vulnerability, without power, is warm but irrelevant).
  * By being vulnerable, you're offering up the valuable opportunity for others to hurt and
    humiliate you.
    * "Friendship is the dividend of gratitude that flows from an acknowledgment that one has
      offered something very valuable by talking."
* Friendships
  * In short, be more friendly, and people will reciprocate.
  * Argues that people don't have well-defined thinking about whether they deeply like you as a
    friend. So you can deepen the friendship by showing that you like them.
    * "We have every opportunity to turn the situation in our direction. We can dare to persuade
      them to see us in a positive light, chiefly by showing a great deal of evidence that we see
      them in a positive light. We can apply the full range of techniques of charm: we can remember
      small things about them, display an interest in what they have been up to, laugh at their
      witty moments, and sympathize with them around their sorrows."
  * "Friendships cannot develop until one side takes a risk and shows they are ready to like even
    when there's as yet no evidence that they are liked back."
  * "We should stop worrying quite so much whether or not people like us, and make that far more
    interesting and socially useful move: concentrate on showing that we like them."
  * Warm person
    * "They do not equate friendliness with a relentlessly upbeat tone." They know it's OK to be sad
      and anxious sometimes.
    * "They don't want to flatter us in ways that could raise the cost of revealing anything more
      despairing or confused" about ourselves.
    * Contrast this to the cold voices "we so frequently hear in commercial contexts that ask us if
      we're having a great day today and that wish us a perfect afternoon in a city we've just
      touched down in."
* Good listening
  * "We come to social life greedy to speak rather than listen, hungry to meet others but reluctant
    to hear them."
  * Good listeners help the speaker move from unconfused and agitated, to clear and serene.
    * "The good listener takes it for granted that they will encounter vagueness in the conversation
      of others. But they don't condemn, rush, or get impatient, because they see vagueness as a
      universal and highly significant trouble of the mind that it is the task of a true friend to
      help with."
    * (I struggle with this; when I see someone having trouble communicating through ambiguity that
      I don't myself have about the situation, I get impatient.)
  * "They don't, as most people do, interrupt to intrude their own ideas; they interrupt to help the
    other get back to their original, more sincere yet elusive concerns."
* Social catastrophe
  * In recovering from severe faux pas, the author wonders whether we should just shut up and accept
    the failure, rather than profusely apologizing, justifying, or back-pedaling.

## Calm (chap 6)

* Pessimism: a tool to improve satisfaction. The lower the expectations of relationships, sex, work,
  children, politics, the greater our satisfaction in the actual outcomes.
  * Self-esteem: (success / expectations).
* A need to be alone
  * "At a certain point, we have had enough of conversations that take us away from our own thought
    processes, enough of external demands that stop us heeding our inner tremors, enough of the
    pressure for superficial cheerfulness that denies the legitimacy of our latent melancholy -- and
    enough of robust common sense that flattens our peculiarities and less well-charted ideas.
  * Retreating to be alone allows us to be our best selves when we return to fellow humans. Rested,
    processed, full of original opinions.
* The importance of staring out the window
  * A period of purpose-free calm, where the birds in our mind, the ones that help constitute our
    identity, can land and be considered. This activity is not celebrated in a productivity-obsessed
    culture.
* Nature
  * Watching a sunset after a hectic work day
    * "At this moment, nature seems to be sending us a humbling message: the incidents of our lives
      are not terribly important. And yet, strangely, rather than being distressing, this sensation
      can be a source of immeasurable solace and calm."
  * The scene of a desert, where nothing changes day to day, and changes take centuries. Our lives
    come and go and mean little on such time scales.
  * "A central task of culture should be to remind us that the laws of nature apply to us as well as
    to trees, clouds, and cliff faces. Our goal is to get clearer about where our own tantalizingly
    powerful yet always limited agency stops: where we will be left with no option but to bow to
    forces infinitely greater than our own."
* Acceptance
  * Pursuit of calm: aiming to be calmer this year than in years past. Accepting that there will be
    many periods where we are not calm.

## Getting together (chap 7)

* Romanticism: "a disaster for love and relationships."
  * "Our strongest cultural voices have, to our huge cost, given us a very unhelpful script to apply
    to a hugely tricky task."
* Myths of romanticism
  * Love will be just as strong 20 years later, after kids.
    * "It's deeply hopeful about marriage. It tells us that marriage could combine all the
      excitement of a love affair with all the advantages of a settled and practical union."
  * Sex was made the pinnacle expression of love, coupling the two.
  * Our partner will understand us intuitively
  * Intuition beats analysis
  * "True love accepts the other person for who they are."
  * We don't need an education in love
    * "We don't need an education to become a lover -- we will pick that up along the way, by
      following our feelings."
  * "We should have no secrets and spend constant time together (work shouldn't get in the way)."
* "Classic" framework of love
  * Realizing that we are rather flawed, and our partner is too, is of huge benefit to a couple in
    increasing the amount of tolerance and generosity in circulation
  * We need to make immense and often rather artificial-sounding efforts to understand one another
    because intuition will never be enough
* Realize that each of us "is a hellish proposition"
  * "We are necessarily going to bring an awesome amount of trouble into someone's life.
* The hellishness of others
  * Success hinges on how we interpret the reasons behind their repeated failings.
  * (The author provides some charitable interpretations of bad behavior, often stemming from the
    spouse's childhood, which seem to me too convenient and quaint to be credible...)
  * Our existing partner is disadvantaged by their incumbency; we know their flaws well. A stranger
    is alluring because we're ignorant about them. But the stranger is hellish, just like our
    partner.
* The longing for reassurance
  * Argues that the fear of rejection persists daily through long relationships. It's not just the
    beginning. Any minor withdraw or tiff can trigger it.
  * When we deny our own fear of rejection, frequently one becomes either avoidant or controlling.
  * Says avoidant coping is learned as a child, when we tried to be close but got rejected or
    humiliated.
    * "We grow suspicious, frantic, and easily furious in the face of the ambiguous moments of
      love."
  * Anxious: our touching concern for connection unfortunately manifests as an attack.
  * People are afraid to ask "do you still care?"
    * "We force them to show us their commitment by putting them through an obstacle course of
      administrative chores. We get very angry rather than admit, with serenity, that we're worried.
      We ward off our vulnerability by denigrating the person who eludes us.
  * "We should uncouple the admission of need from any associations with the unfortunate and
    punitive term "neediness." We must get better at seeing the love and longing that lurk behind
    some of our and our partner's most cold, stern, or managerial moments." (sounds difficult)
* Partner-as-child; the "infant model of interpretation"
  * With children, we forgive their obnoxious, hurtful behavior because we don't assign mean
    intentions to kids. We have benevolent explanations for their behavior.
  * Consider doing the same with adults.
    * "It's very touching that we live in a world where we have learned to be so kind to children;
      it would be even nicer if we learned to be a little more generous toward the childlike parts
      of one another."
    * Everyone is generally very good at loving little children. Argues that parts of adults will
      always remain childish, because they're tied to how the person was a a kid. And this is the
      case with all adults.
  * (This theory is helpful; I could see how it would soften my interpretations. But how far can one
    take it, really? Do you want as your partner, someone who manifests emotionally as a 3 year old?
    How do you collaborate and problem-solve?
  * "The problem with adults is that they look misleadingly adult."
* For the ancient Greeks, love is to adore someone's positive traits. For the negative traits, help
  educate them out of them.
  * "Good teachers know that timing is critical."
  * Nagging is an attempt to education.
    * "Lamentably, it doesn't work. Nagging breeds its evil twin, shirking. The other pretends to
      read the paper, goes upstairs and feels righteous. The shrillness of one's tone gives them all
      the excuse they need to trust that we have nothing kind or true to tell them."
    * "We nag because we feel that our possession of the truth lets us off having to convey it
      elegantly. It never does. The solution to nagging isn't to give up trying to get others to do
      what we want. Rather, it is to recognize that persuasion always needs to be couched in terms
      that make intuitive sense to those we want to alter."

## Dealing with problems (chap 9)

* An average couple will have between thirty and fifty significant arguments a year.
* We assume our relationship is the exception, and that everyone else isn't having frequent severe
  arguments.
* "The tragedy of every sorry argument is that it is constructed around a horrific mismatch between
  the message we so badly want to send ('I need you to love me, know me, agree with me') and the
  manner in which we are able to deliver it (with impatient accusations, sulks, put-downs, sarcasm,
  exaggerated gesticulations, and forceful 'fuck you's)
* "We would do things so much better if we care a little less" about it landing -- about them
  agreeing with us and validating us.
* Arguments can't sustainably be avoided; only handled better.
* Types of arguments
  * The interminable argument: Arguments about disagreeing opinions on things, which are actually
    about "you don't respect my intelligence."
  * The defensive argument
    * People don't change when they are told gleefully by their partner what is wrong with them.
    * Regarding "winning" arguments: "this is fundamentally to misunderstand the point of
      relationships, which is not so much to defeat an opponent as to help each other evolve into
      the best versions of ourselves" -- the mistaken belief that "whoever is right should win the
      argument".
  * Spoiling argument: spoiling the cheery mood of the other partner so they can be on the same
    gloomy level as us. Doesn't work. Once their cheery afternoon is spoiled, they will resent you
    rather than connect with you.
  * Absentee argument: the partner becomes a sink for every large disappointment in our lives, like
    a plateauing career, jealousy over the success of our old college friends, declining health.
    * The author argues that this is a marked cry for love and help. (really...?)
  * Argument of normality: appeals to majority opinion to justify our preferences.
    * Appealing to the majority should, logically, have little sway in an argument. The majority is
      often wrong/unwise, and the minority sometimes particularly wise.
  * Argument from excessive logic
    * While admired, usually what we want more than reason is comfort, reassurance, and emotional
      empathy. Logical replies, while correct, can still be unhelpful.
* Pessimism
  * The solution to our agitation lies in a philosophy of pessimism: "in the expectation of a blunt
    inevitability that two people will never understand more than a fraction of each other's minds."
  * The only people we can think of as profoundly admirable are those we don't yet know very well.
  * "Every human can be guaranteed to frustrate, anger, annoy, madden, and disappoint us -- and we
    will (without any malice) do the same to them."
* Unrequited love
  * "It isn't their charms that are keeping us magnetized; it is our lack of knowledge of their
    flaws."
  * The cure for unrequited love is more knowledge, so that they cease to look like the ultimate
    love for us. More knowledge will "set you free."
  * "The corrective to insufficient knowledge is experience. We need to mine the secret reality of
    other people and places to learn that, beneath their charms, they will almost invariably be
    essentially "normal" in nature: that is, no worse yet no better than the incumbents we already
    understand."
    * Incumbent jobs and partners may seem less attractive than a shiny new alternative, but it's
      just that we have an asymmetry of knowledge and don't know the new thing very well.
  * "We should extrapolate what we already know of people and apply it to those we don't yet."
* The laundry
  * Romanticism ignores the practical fact that partners will collaborate heavily on all mundane
    domestic matters, and doing so well is essential for the relationship. It requires a surprising
    amount of energy and attention.
  * "It's problems that feel trivial or silly but nevertheless take up large sections of our lives
    that drive us to heightened states of agitation. Such agitation is precisely what the Romantic
    neglect of domestic life has unwittingly encouraged."
    * And the impatience / agitation erodes the relationship over years.
* "It was meant to be nicer"
  * As children we were cherished. In marriage, that tends to wear off quickly and our partner isn't
    all that interested in the details of our lives and feelings. So don't judge our marital care
    against how we were treated as kids.
* "The wisdom of compromise": the author makes the argument that, in short, it's possible that
  nursing yourself through a lifetime of sadness in a relationship is better than the alternatives.
  And it certainly shouldn't be labeled as "cowardice."
  * "Wiser societies would be careful never to stigmatize the act of compromise. It is painful
    enough to have to do it; it is even more painful to have to hate oneself for having done so."
  * (Sounds woefully depressing and defeatist)
* A modest argument for marriage
  * It's good that the institution makes it hard to "throw in the towel."
  * Marriage acts as a formal obstacle to make one's impulses less dangerous.
    * "We don't need a marriage certificate to show affection and admiration. And indeed, forcing
      commitment only increases the danger of eventual inauthenticity and dishonesty. If love
      doesn't work out, being married simply make sit much harder to disentangle two lives and
      prolongs the agony of a dysfunctional union."
    * "We deliberately invite an elderly aunt or uncle whom we don't even like much to fly around
      the world to be there. We are willingly creating a huge layer of embarrassment were we ever to
      turn round and admit it might have been a mistake."
  * Long relationships allows for gradual self-development: "It's too easy to seem kind and normal
    when we keep starting new relationships." But true self-improvement can only come when
    considering others' views of us over long periods of time.
  * Some types of investments require security. Like having children, giving up one's career.

## Work (chap 10)

* All important, ambitious efforts cause some enemies.
  * Being mature involves a frank relationship with one's own darkness, complexity, and ambition. It
    involves accepting that not everything that makes us happy will please others or be honored as
    especially "nice".
* A beginner's mind: the belief that we are, by nature, foolish, and the ability to let go of trying
  to demonstrate our own dignity, and explore the world as a beginner would.
* As kids, we play at many professions. Each of these "games" is a plausible alternate version of
  ourselves. We're forced to specialize in adulthood to reap the benefits of mastery, income, and
  the stability required to raise a family. The parallel with relationships is that we have to
  choose one path and learn to live with the loss of the many potential alternate paths that we've
  had to forego.
  * "We may with a certain melancholic pride remove the job search engine from our bookmarks and
    cancel our subscription to a dating site in due recognition of the fact that, whatever we do,
    parts of our potential will have to go undeveloped and have to die without ever having had the
    chance to come to fully maturity -- for the sake of the benefits of focus and specialization."
  * (This sounds terribly sad and resigned. Why shut off the ambitious, wondering portion of our
    brains?)
* On consumerism
  * "The real crisis of capitalism is that product development lags so far behind the best insights
    of advertising. Since the 1960s, advertising has worked out just how much we need help with the
    true challenges of life."
  * A lifestyle ad campaign can make you long for lost moments, like the sweet times past of rolling
    around on the carpet with your young kids, but can't deliver any solutions for you. A watchmaker
    cannot create for us a beautiful father-son relationship.
  * Businesses target only the lower needs of Maslov's pyramid. "We have simply accepted... that
    there is nothing business can do to address [the higher needs], when in fact, being able to
    structure businesses around these needs would be the commercial equivalent of the discovery of
    steam power or the invention of the electric light bulb."
    * (The one modern "product" I'm aware of that can help with the higher needs is
      coaching/therapy; coaching for the marriage, parenting, career, lifestyle. It's the
      productization of wisdom and self-discovery of the more important topics in life.)
    * "The challenge now is to narrow the gap between the fantasies being offered and what we truly
      spend our lives doing and our money buying."
* On society's view of poverty
  * "The fate of lacemakers, but also office cleaners, warehouse attendants, delivery workers, and
    manual laborers would be substantially improved" if we could see the dignity and intensity of
    their work and feel respect for them, and so take the humiliation away from poverty.
  * "An artist like Netscher isn't changing how much the low-paid earn; he is changing how the
    low-paid are judged. This is not an unimportant piece of progress."

## Culture (chap 11)

* (An essay on the differences between classical and romanticism)
  * Romanticism dominates modern thinking. It has many truths to impart, but must be balanced with
    Classical thinking.
* "We need to fall silent -- more frequently than we do -- and simply listen."
* Romanticism: "authenticity is the highest form of morality. Politeness is a lid that we place upon
  our real selves to suppress the truths that could free us."
  * Classical: "Strategic inauthenticity is the mark of a kindly soul."
* Classical: "they are familiar enough with extremes to welcome things that are a little boring.
  They can see the charm of doing the laundry."
* Purity
  * Maturity: "The classical person takes the view that very few things, and no people, are either
    wholly good or entirely bad. They assume that there is likely to be some worth in opposing ideas
    and something to be learned from both sides. It is Classical to think that a decent person might
    in many areas hold views you find deeply unpalatable."
  * "A political party can't be admirable at every turn."
* People have come to dislike cheap things
  * "Industrialization has inadvertently... robbed certain experiences of their loveliness, interest
    and worth" by making those products cheap and wisely available. Our psychology devalues them as
    a result.
  * We have mistakenly come to treat price as a token of intrinsic value.
  * Around 8, children understand what cheap vs expensive means, and now their method of value
    becomes price.
  * Solution? We can't change our knowledge of the price, but we can pay less attention to what
    things cost and more to our own responses.
  * "The price of something is principally determined by what it cost to make, not how much human
    value is potentially to be derived from it."
* Solace
  * (These are beautiful, comforting thoughts)
  * Books are a potential salve for the inevitable loneliness that we all face. They provide
    imaginary companions.
  * A psychoanalyst studying children in the 1950s: "certain children coped with the absence of
    their parents through 'transitional objects' to keep the memory of parental love strong even
    when the parents weren't there." A teddy bear, blanket, became a mechanism for activating that
    memory of being cared for.
  * Virtual friends, mentors, to give us solace and companionship
    * "Strangely, it appears that certain imaginary friends drawn from culture can end up feeling
      more real and in that sense more present to us than any of our real-life acquaintances, even
      if they have been dead a few centuries and lived on another continent. We can feel honored to
      count them among our best friends."
  * "The arts allow us to become the soulmates of people who, despite having been born in in 1600,
    are, in limited but crucial ways, our proper companions. The friendship may even be deeper than
    that we could have enjoyed in person, for it is spared all the normal compromises that attend
    social interactions."
  * "Confronted by the many failings of our real-life communities, culture gives us the option of
    assembling a tribe for ourselves, drawing their members across the widest ranges of time and
    space, blending some living friends with some dead authors, architects, musicians, and
    composers, painters and poets."
  * What an honor, for one deceased, to be counted as a friend among the future generations of the
    living.
* "Good enough"
  * Be happy with "good enough." Perfectionism in relationships creates emotional agony. Good enough
    relationships can still have very dark moments.
    * This sounds like mollifying the urge to escape mediocrity, and instead settle for one's
      depressing lot. But maybe if it really, truly is "sufficiently good", it's not settling, but
      rather preserving.
  * "No child, he insisted, needs an ideal parent. They just need an OK, pretty decent, usually
    well-intentioned, sometimes grumpy but basically reasonable father or mother."
* Elements of wisdom
  * Appreciation
    * "it isn't that they are sentimental and naive; in fact, precisely the opposite. Because they
      have seen how hard things can get, they know how to draw the full value from the peaceful and
      the sweet -- whenever and wherever these arise."
      * Seeing the charm of a 3 year old playing in a garden.
  * Folly
    * The wise budget for madness in others.
    * "The wise are unsurprised by the ongoing coexistence of deep immaturity and perversity
      alongside quite adult qualities like intelligence and morality."
  * Politeness
    * "They'll be aware of how differently things can look through the eyes of others and will
      search more for what people have in common than for what separates them."
  * Forgiveness
    * The wise are slow to judge.
  * Regrets
    * "Regret lessens the more we see that error is endemic across the species. We can't look at
      anyone's life story without seeing some devastating mistakes etched across it. These errors
      are not coincidental but structural. They arise because we all lack the information we need to
      make choices in time-sensitive situations. We are all, where it counts, steering almost
      blind."
  * Calm
    * The wise know that when an entire day is calm, it's something to be savored and appreciated.
