# The Seven Principles of Making Marriage Work - John Gottman

## Gems

* Friendship is the foundation of a good marriage, because it imbues the relationship with
  positivity, which provides security and helps the couple push through conflict and annoyance.
* Repair attempts are key.
* "Harsh startup" determines the outcome of the discussion.

## Intro (chap 1)

* People in unhappy marriages die faster, are more prone to sickness, and their children are more
  likely to have behavioral problems.
* Half of divorces happen within the first 7 years of the marriage.
* Gottman's approach was to study couples in a Love Lab -- a synthetic environment where they could
  study the nature of the conflict.
* The foundation of a happy marriage is a strong friendship. It creates a general positivity about
  the relationship that reduces the chance that conflict will spin out of control.
* Don't work on conflict resolution techniques. Instead work on building the friendship.
* Improvements in one of the seven areas will positively impact the other areas.

## Predictors of divorce (chap 2)

* The presence of the four horsemen: criticism, contempt, defensiveness, stonewalling.
  * Criticism: generalizing the complaint to the person. "I asked you to sweep the floor last night.
    Why are you so forgetful?"
  * Contempt: sarcasm, cynicism, name calling, sneering, mockery. It's poisonous, because it conveys
    disgust.
  * Defensiveness: this is an indirect way of saying that the attacker is at fault, and so isn't
    going to repair.
  * Stonewalling: rather than confronting, he disengages and turns away ("checks out"). He avoids
    the fights, but is also avoiding his marriage. Far more common behavior among men.
* The presence of flooding.
* When discussion begin with "harsh startups".

## 1: Love maps (i.e. build friendship) (chap 3)

* Discover things like your spouses best friends, preferred family members, fears and hopes, current
  stresses.
* (The book provides some questionnaires for getting to know someone, like a close friend, which
  sounded fun and comprehensive).
* "Who am I" exploration. Write answers individually, then share notes:
  * My triumphs
  * My injuries and ways to heal
  * My emotional world
  * My mission and legacy
  * Who I want to become
* We all change significantly over time, especially around major life events like house, kids,
  career change. You can lose sight of your spouse if you don't have a good routine for maintaining
  love maps.

## 2: Nurture your fondness and admiration (chap 4)

* To re-center on your relationship, focus again on your partner's positive characteristics,
  reminding yourself of why you love this person in the first place. Recall the history that got you
  together.
* Fondness and admiration are the antidote for contempt.
* Exercises in this book:
  * I appreciate…: list things you appreciate about your partner. Ground it in an incident. Then
    share it with your partner.
  * 'The history and philosophy or your marriage: highlight the positive history and the love which
    brought the couple together.
  * 'Seven Week Course in Fondness and Admiration': a schedule of daily rehearsing of positive
    thoughts and a related tasks which positively

## 3: Turn towards each other and not away (chap 5)

* Stay connected about the mundane things in life so you can begin accruing into the emotional bank
  account rather than leaving it empty.
* These interactions are the foundation for romance and connection -- beyond just the cushion of
  conflict that admiration gives.
* How to have stress-reducing conversations about each other's lives:
  * Take turns
  * No unsolicited advice
  * Show genuine interest
  * Communicate your understanding
  * Take your spouse’s side
  * Take the "we against others" attitude
  * Express affection
  * Validate emotions

## 4: Let your partner influence you (chap 6)

* Share power. Men typically have a harder time with this than women.
* It's an investment in the relationship. Even if you think you're right, sharing power might be the
  wiser choice in the decision.
* Gottman found that in the long-run, the happiest and most stable marriages are those where the
  couple works as a team -- they consider each other's perspectives/feelings and seek common ground
  where there's a disagreement.

## 5: Solve solvable problems (chap 7, 8, 9)

* 70% of conflicts fall into the perpetual variety.
  * Since they're perpetual by nature, you must chose a partner who's differences you can live with
    and cope with. Choosing your spouse is the same as choosing your set of unsolvable problems.
  * If the problems cannot be coped with, they become obstacles, and the couple gets into a
    gridlock, leading to the four horsemen.
  * Many happy marriages exist without having resolved any of their big issues.
* Techniques
  * Soften your startup
    * Arguments end in the same tone that they begin.
    * Couples divorce because of the distancing to avoid fights, rather than the actual fights.
    * Women tend to have harsher startups.
    * "I'm so tired today because of work; can you please take the garbage out?" vs. "what's wrong
      with you? You never take the garbage out!"
    * Complain, but don't blame.
    * Make "I" statements: speak about what the situation does to you.
    * Describe what's happening; don't judge or evaluate.
    * Be explicit and specific with what you want. Your partner isn't a mind reader.
    * Be appreciative.
  * Make repair attempts
    * These are brakes on the conversation to prevent escalation.
    * The most important property is that they're obvious, recognizable, and "get through" to your
      spouse.
    * Examples:
      * I'm feeling scared.
      * Can you make things safer for me?
      * Please be gentler with me.
      * Can we take a break? I'm starting to feel flooded.
      * I can see my part in all of this.
      * Let's find our common ground.
      * Hang in there -- don't withdraw.
      * This is not your problem -- it's our problem.
    * When a person is flooded (heart rate > 100 bpm), discussion has to stop, before stonewalling
      begins. The flooded person can't hear what's being said.
    * Soothe yourself and each other
      * These are techniques for returning from being flooded.
      * Some couples can self-soothe as part of a discussion. Ideally, your partner is a critical
        part of your soothing process, which ties you together.
      * Examples
        * You give each other massages to calm down.
        * Lie down
        * 10m of deep breathing
  * Compromise
    * You don't need to accept everything your partner argues for, but you do need to accept some of
      it.
    * Men typically have a harder time accepting influence from their wives than vice versa.
    * Exercise: find common ground. Draw a circle. Write the non-negotiable things inside,
      negotiable things outside. Start negotiating using this info.
* Common solvable problems
  * Bringing stress from outside into the marriage
    * E.g. wife is upset because there's no food after a crappy day of work and the husband forgot
      to get groceries. The blowup is not personal, but rather situational.
    * Solutions: clear coordination of responsibilities; a destressing break between work and home;
      regular whining sessions about work, while the other is supportive.
  * In-laws
    * Establish a sense of "we-ness" or solidarity between husband and wife.
    * Spouse must prefer the marriage first. It's their new nuclear family. This does not mean they
      love their family of origin less. But the in-laws must get used to it and accept it.
  * Money
    * Be better organized with money.
    * Plan your goals and trade off some of yours for the other.
  * Sex
    * Since it has a huge potential for hurt, embarrassment, and rejection, couples tend to
      negotiate about it in vague, imprecise terms.
    * Solutions: learn to speak about sex in a safe way, and more clearly; accommodate what your
      partner wants as much as you're comfortable doing so.
    * "Lovemaking with a critical partner ends up usually being quite short and sucky."
  * Housework
    * Goal: create a sense of fairness and teamwork.
    * Commonly one person has higher standards than another and it creates resentment and lack of
      appreciation.
    * Solution: men do more, since they're usually doing less. Women are more attracted to these
      kinds of men.
    * "Who does what" exercise: map out all existing chores, with two columns: now, ideal. Discuss.
  * Becoming parents
    * Solutions:
      * Work on the marital friendship (although don't seesaw between investing in the spouse and
        then the baby).
      * Have the dad care for the baby, and don't supervise him.
      * Give mom a break.

## 6: Overcoming gridlock (chap 10)

* Gridlock happens when people's life dreams are not being addressed/respected by the other person.
* In a healthy marriage, couples believe that the marriage is helping them with those dreams, and
  they're not instead being manipulated out of achieving their dreams.
* Some dreams are hidden and won't be shared unless the marriage feels safe.
* Solutions:
  * Become a dream detective. Unearth dreams which are hidden, or which were implicitly put away
    when the marriage began. They will eventually surface as gridlock conflict.
  * Work on ungridlocking the dream:
    * Understand their position; ask for I statements
    * Honor their dream
    * Try to partake: via listening, financial support, or taking part.
    * Look hard for semi-permanent compromises
  * Sooth each other. It's hard to have conflicting dreams. Flooding occurs.

## 7: Creating shared meaning (chap 11)

* Build a family "culture", with symbols and rituals, so there's meaning and connection beyond the
  daily chores of marriage.
* Examples
  * High-quality family dinner time
  * Holidays
  * Rites of passage
  * Community
  * Celebrating positive and negative events
  * Lovemaking

## Magic Five Hours (chap 12)

* An investment plan of 5 hours per week to significantly renew the marriage.
* Parting: before saying goodbyes in the morning, find out one thing which is happening in the
  partner's life that day.
* Reunions: stress-reducing conversations at the end of each workday.
* Admiration and appreciation: find some way every day to communicate genuine affection and
  appreciation towards your spouse.
* Affection: kiss, hold, grab and touch each other when together.
* Weekly date: could be a relaxing low-pressure way to stay connected. Ask each other questions (to
  update your love-maps) and turn towards each other. Talking out a marital issue or working through
  an argument can also be placed here.
