  * Boundaries help your kids feel emotionally safe. Like swaddling. Kids push on boundaries until they get a
    firm no. They are looking for the safety of clarity.
  * Before you say no, do a quick calculation of whether you will give in eventually anyway. If so, just give
    in right away and say yes. It makes you generous, and a holder of your word. Don't be a hard ass all the
    time. Don't be inconsistent -- saying no, but then later saying yes when pushed.

  * Sleep is the base of the behavior pyramid. It's the first thing to diagnose when there's repeated

  * Parenting philosophies stand in the way of good parenting. Use and develop your intuition. Feel confident.
  * Education
    * Parents invariably get a "teacher voice" that's above the kid, and it's disconnecting.
    * Sometimes we stuff them with information. It's unnatural. We're worrying about their future rather than
      being present. Let them experience.
  * You say "be careful" 100 times while they're at the playground. Let them make mistakes.
  * For parents, it's a horrible and insidious thing to feel like your kids should never get hurt. Parents
    feel shamed when their kid gets hurt. Both parents and kids must not be afraid to fail.
    * Instead of saying "be careful", prompt the child to have their own awareness. "Do you see the poison ivy?
      Do you feel how the rock is slippery? How do you think you will you get down? Who will help you if you
      fall?"
  * Discipline: favor "natural consequences" model over "punishment"
    * Follow through with what you say.
  * We don't give our toddlers the time they need to listen and respond. Their processing is not that fast
    yet. We talk too much. We overwhelm them with verbal context: "I'll be late for work; put on your shoes.
    You should know this by now!"
    * It flies by them, they don't acknowledge most of it, and all of our reprimands remain shallow and glance
      off of them.

* Intro
  * Framework for progression of toddler to teen: "governing, then gardening, then guiding."
    * Parents often switch to operating in the latter two, but they don't apply until > 6 years old. A young
      child is exploring boundaries and needs governance.
  * It's the child's job to push against the boundaries and your job to hold them, and to teach consequences.
    * Reframe this from "bad" to "exciting". They're growing!
  * At 30 months, kids individuate. They stop being joyful followers of you, and start trying to figure
    themselves out.
  * Dog analogy: they're like a dog at this age. A dog takes its cue from your body language. The dog needs to
    feel that you are the alpha and that they don't need to lead. If they don't feel that, they will fill that
    role and try to lead and protect you.
    * If you're frustrated by your dog, it will show in your body language: slumped over and resentful.
      Instead feel excited and proud of your dog.
  * "The recent push of early intellectualism coupled with a desire to “make childhood magical” has created a
    strange paradox—we have three-year-olds with math and Mandarin tutors who don’t know how to dress
    themselves and are sitting in their own poop."

* Boundaries (chap 1)
  * Toddlers don't yet have the brain development for self control. They can't lead themselves, the parent, or
    the grandparents, so don't expect them to.
  * Physical boundaries are clearer. Everyone recognizes that dogs and kids can't navigate a parking lot by
    themselves, and so we're very firm with them in those situations. We don't plead with the child for
    control, we exert it, lovingly and kind.
  * Boundaries help your kids feel emotionally safe. Like swaddling. Kids push on boundaries until they get a
    firm no. They are looking for the safety of clarity.
  * Kids can be terrorists. "We don't negotiate with terrorists." They can't handle the power yet.
  * Before you say no, do a quick calculation of whether you will give in eventually anyway. If so, just give
    in right away and say yes. It makes you generous and a holder of your word. Don't be a hard ass all the
    time. Don't be inconsistent: saying no, but then later saying yes when pushed.
  * Mental and emotional boundaries are harder to define than physical.
  * All toddlers need slow transitions between activities. Rushing the morning routine because they slept in
    late is going to be a mess. That's why getting sleep right is so important.
  * Sleep is the base of the behavior pyramid. It's the first thing to diagnose when there's repeated
    undesirable behavior. Kids who are out of control at bed time will delay their sleep, and it snowballs
    because they get messed up by their circadian rhythm.
  * Everyone in your life will be better off knowing your boundaries. Making them clear is not being mean.
    * It's much more helpful than someone with weak boundaries
      who then later copes with withdraw and resentment.

* Parenting philosophies (chap 2)
  * If you're trying to diligently follow some big popular parenting philosophy, you can miss the kid in front
    of you.
  * Attachment theory
    * The outcome you're looking for in this framework is that your kid feels attached and secure; bonded.
      They can play independently in confidence.
  * If a philosophy is not working for the family as a whole (like co-sleeping) then it's not working and
    shouldn't be forced.
  * Life shouldn't be about the kid. It isolates them from others and the community. In contrast, wearing kids
    in a carrier is good because you can act as you normally would, and they still get to participate.
  * "My child won't let me X" should never be a lament . E.g. "won't let me focus, talk on the phone, work
    out." (what was her recommendation here?)
  * A parent who is emotionally volatile is not providing safety for their kids. Kids want boring
    predictability so they can know that their boundaries in life are reliable.
  * Styles of parental authority
    * Authoritarian: bend the child's will to an authority.
    * Authoritative: more pragmatic, balanced, respecting both the child and parent.
    * Permissive: avoid confrontation and discipline. Let the kid figure it out. Assume they have the
      capability.
      * "Govern, garden, guide is a beautiful framework. Each stage builds on the previous. You don't want to
        be stuck governing during the kid's later years, when they're blossoming."
    * If you're guiding your preschooler, you're being too permissive. They don't want to be guided. They want
      boundaries and governance.

* Connection (chap 3)
  * True connection is what it's about. Not just being in the same room together.
    * Seeing the person, being present, loving them for who they are, not multi-tasking.
  * Examples of connecting
    * Have them help with chores, cooking.
    * We expect bedtime reading to be connecting, but often we make it disconnecting, because it's late and
      we're setting up boundaries as we go.
      * (But we have to set boundaries, so how to balance the two?)
  * Examples of disconnecting
    * "Uh huh" parenting (when your kid is trying to tell you something)
    * Multitasking. Instead, engage with your child for some concentrated time.
    * Cruising through bed time or not engaging when your kid wants to show you something.
  * Connecting activities fill your cup too because you feel like a great parent.
  * Kids need slow transitions. Consider packing their schedule less, so you can be focused on the time with
    them, and who they are, rather than being focused on shuttling them between activities.
  * People will forget what you've said and do, but will never forget how you made them feel.

* Self care for parents (chap 4)
  * Teach your kids the lesson of self care by demonstrating it yourself. Connection trickles down from a
    healthy individual, to family, to kids.
  * The hour when one of the working parents gets home is actually when both parents need a break to
    successfully transition from childcare (for stay-at-home parents) or from a hard day at work into
    connecting time as a family.
    * Consider having a nanny bathe the kids at that time, so you can get a break. Go for a walk, play video
      games, or exercise.

* Not enough time (chap 5)
  * Pareto principle: 80% of your results come from 20% of your time. Find the lower ROI time and cut it,
    given your time is scarce.
  * Pick 3 big "stones" that you want to pack into your day and week (or year). Focus on those, use them as
    anchors. Those priorities don't shift. Don't focus on the smaller stuff.
  * Staying up too late is "fake productivity." It feels like you're being with yourself and that it's self
    care, but it's ultimately draining, because you're tired during that time, and it makes you tired for the
    next day.
  * Pick up toys, clean the kitchen, once a day. Interim cleanliness affords you no value.
  * Chunk time. Communicate in chunks. Email batch once a day; texts also. Consider putting your phone in
    airplane mode otherwise.

* Parental anxiety (chap 6)
  * Don't get lost in the research of how to raise your child. Your children move on and grow every day, and
    you'll lose a lot of time that way, trying to implement the latest research. And this approach undermines
    your intuition.
  * For the most part, intuition is the only parenting philosophy you will have time for anyway, so develop
    it.
  * Parenting philosophies stand in the way of good parenting. Use and develop your intuition. Feel confident.

* Stop educating (chap 8)
  * The sharp edges of teaching
    * Education and tutoring makes us miss the boat. Childhood is not a race. Toddlers need to learn skills
      like patience and self regulation, not specific knowledge or academic skills.
    * Parents invariably get a "teacher voice" that's above the kid, and it's disconnecting.
    * Often they want us to acknowledge something they've done. Or just play, and we inject some educational
      content they don't care about. It's not being present, it's bringing in your agenda.
    * Sometimes we stuff them with information. It's unnatural. We're worrying about their future rather than
      being present. Let them experience.
    * Avoid talking *at* the child. Throwing words at them rather than conversing; lecturing; blabbering about
      what's on your mind? How does it feel when adults do that to you?
  * Play
    * Childhood is about play; especially at this age. They learn through play. Foster that, and engage.
    * Legos, marble runs, fort building tape and scissors develop the muscles needed for writing.
    * Tinkering; let them take apart old electronics; it's a precursor to engineering.
    * Free flowing artwork.

* Executive functioning (chap 9)
  * Executive functioning means mental control and self regulation.
  * Use whiteboards to make lists for your kids so they can understand the order of things they need to do.
    E.g. the morning routine. Most kids don't have this skill and get lost along the way, and it surprises us.
  * Ways to develop:
    * Memory games, matching games.
    * Chess
    * Deck of cards: Uno and solitaire.

* Cultivating creativity (chap 11)
  * Creativity will result in innovation and problem solving. It's a gift to cultivate this in your kid.
  * Expect no set outcome: how the picture turns out, with how the game unfolds.
  * Prompt your child to tell you a weird story.

* Physical development (chap 12)
  * You say "be careful" 100 times while they're at the playground.
    * You don't even realize.
    * They have to develop. Let them make mistakes.
  * "Big rough play" is the prereq for being able to sit still.
    * If you want your kid to sit still in church, give them a hard run before service, like you would a dog.
      Otherwise, they will be sensory seeking, and their bodies will squirm and wriggle to be let loose.
  * Let them climb up the slide. Let them play tag.
  * Don't break up fights so fast. Rough physical play has been there since the dawn of kids.
  * For parents, it's a horrible and insidious thing to feel like your kids should never get hurt. Parents
    feel shamed when their kid gets hurt. Both parents and kids must not be afraid to fail.
  * Instead of saying "be careful", prompt the child to have their own awareness. "Do you see the poison ivy?
    Do you feel how the rock is slippery? How do you think you will you get down? Who will help you if you
    fall?"

* Free play (chap 13)
  * Free play is defined as: "kid led play, outside."
    * Letting them play a sport is not the same. It's structured by adults.
  * Let kids work their social structure out themselves. We step in to conflict resolve; we demand "say you're
    sorry!" But they don't mean it, and don't learn that way. When they see they've hurt another kid, they
    usually build empathy themselves and try to make amends. At least at the preschool age.

* More sleep (chap 14)
  * (She had strong opinions about this. Thinks all modern toddlers need more sleep. This was a good sleep chapter).
  * We have sleep deprived toddlers.
  * Think of sleep as a nutrient.
  * Always err on the side of more sleep. They need 10-13 hours. No toddler is sleeping too much.
  * Bed time routine
    * Do yoga or meditation to relax.
    * No screen time. They get very stimulated.
    * Routines should only be 20-30m.
    * Preempt all of the stalls. "Do you have anything you want to tell me? Do you need a sip of water?"
  * Got nightmares? Explore the source of the fears and eliminate that stimulation. E.g. watching a scary show
    that day.

* Physical bodies (chap 15)
  * Validate their physical feelings.
    * Use "Yes, and."
    * "I hear that you're hungry. There's one hour until snack time."
  * Let your child experience the cold, so they can understand first-hand why they need a coat.
    * "Being cold will not make them more susceptible to the flu or a cold."

  * When there's an episode or tantrum, address and validate their feelings before correcting their behavior.
  * Use the words "settle your body" rather than "calm down". No one calms down when asked to.

* Discipline (chap 16)
  * Two models for discipline: punishment and "natural consequences".
  * Punishment is dealing out pain for something you don't like. Parents do it make the connection between the
    behavior and the pain.
  * "Natural consequences" are a part of life.
    * Parents end up preventing the natural consequences by preemptively punishing the behavior that will lead
      to those consequences.
  * Bad behavior is usually just "behavior".
    * Try this thought on for size: "my child isn't giving me a hard time; they're having a hard time."
  * "Time out" doesn't work. It's punishment. The child doesn't think about what they've done.
  * Alternatives:
    * Time in (stop the play and take some time, but together, with you);
    * Example of natural consequences: leave the party, the grocery store. That's what happens to adults if
      they have aggressive behavior. While this can be inconvenient, it's very effective and makes you
      trustworthy.
    * Give the toy a "time out" if there's bad behavior.
  * Follow through with what you say.
  * Temporally, consequences need to happen right after the bad behavior. Not the next day, not later that
    day.
  * If you're triggered, say you'll be back, what happened made you angry, and you need a minute to calm down.
  * Don't bribe the kid out of their bad behavior. It isn't sustainable and creates poor character.

* Getting the toddler to listen (chap 17)
  * We don't give our toddlers the time they need to listen and respond. Their processing is not that fast
    yet. We talk too much. We overwhelm them with verbal context: "I'll be late for work; put on your shoes.
    You should know this by now!"
    * It flies by them, they don't acknowledge most of it, and all of our reprimands remain shallow and glance
      off of them.
  * When they're playing, give them warning times, to allow them to slowly disengage with their deep play.
  * Sit next to then and engage with them until their focus and voice comes back to the present. Then tell
    them they can now close out the activity; one more game, and then the iPad will take a rest!

* Transitions (chap 18)
  * Abrupt transitions are hard on kids.
  * Provide at least a 5m warning between activity changes. Build that time into the morning routine.
  * Give specific, small instructions.
    * "We will leave the library quietly after that book. You will not have a
      fit."
    * "When we get home, get out of the car and put your shoes near the door."
