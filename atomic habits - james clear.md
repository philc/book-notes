* Time magnifies habits; systems are better than goals (chapter 1)
  * Time magnifies habits
    * A successful life is built up of the accumulation of small habits. Just a small change in trajectory
      will send you to a vastly different destination over the course of your life.
    * We can't normally see the impact of small changes because of how long it takes for them to affect
      change. Think about dieting: a few calories on a given day will not seem to affect your results, and so
      you abandon the diet. But over long periods of time, the diet transforms your body composition.
    * Your outcomes are lagging indicator of your habits. Your body weight is an indicator of your diet. Your
      health a lagging indicator of your exercise. Your knowledge a lagging indicator of your rate of
      learning.
    * Time magnifies the effect of your habits: whatever you feed it, that's what it will magnify. So if you
      complete one more task each day, or make it to the gym one more time each week, that will result in a
      huge amount of completed tasks or strength by the end of the year.
  * Systems are better than goals
    * Goals are the outcomes you want. Systems are the process for achieving them. He advises focusing on the
      system. That's entirely in your control. Winners and losers both have the same goals. What separates the
      gold medal winner from the rest is their system.
    * Goals make your impression of your self-worth binary: either you achieved it or you didn't. Systems are
      more general and adaptable. It's very rare that your life takes the direction that your goals sent you.
      It's healthy and easier to take satisfaction in the progress you've made on your system.
    * True long-term thinking is not about goals, but commitment to and enjoyment in the refinement the
      process.

* Changing habits by changing your identity (Chapter 2)
  * Focusing on "who" (your identity) rather than "what" (outcomes).
  * Being consistent with your identity is strong intrinsic motivation.
  * Declare who you are, then prove it to yourself with small positive changes.
  * Example identity change statements:
    * "I'm no longer a smoker" is much more powerful than "I'm trying to quit smoking."
    * "I am a good manager who's growing very fast"
    * "I'm not somebody who bites their nails"
  * Why does it work? Your identity invokes your pride.
    * If you are ripped, you are not the kind of person who misses workouts.
    * If you are not a smoker, you are not the kind of person tempted by a cigarette.
  * Identifies can also be harmful: I'm not good with names, I'm not good at math.
  * How to start with an outcome, and reframe it as an identity change
    * Declare the goal, and think of what kind of person could achieve that goal.
    * "What kind of person could have six pack abs? Healthy person." Then you can focus on becoming that
      person, and not just on the outcome.

* The four laws of behavior change (Chapter 3)
  * Make it obvious
  * Make it attractive
  * Make it easy
  * Make it satisfying

* Making your habits more obvious your habits (Chapter 4)
  * Negative habits
    * Habits are automatic. That makes it hard to tune negative ones.
    * Increase awareness by calling them out loud when you do them. Once they're top of mind (obvious), they
      can be changed.
    * Tool: point and call out loud when you notice a bad habit in action. E.g. you're eating against your
      goals... don't judge, but study and become aware of how you feel and why you're reaching for that
      cooking, and dialogue: "I'm about to have this cookie even though I don't need it."

* Make it obvious (Chapter 5, 6)
  * Implementation intentions: when you set a goal for yourself, specifically describe the time and place and
    how you will do the goal. This prepares your mind for the activity and gives you a cue to start it, so
    there's less resistance to doing it.
  * Habit stacking:
    * Use this implementation intention to link a new habit onto an existing habit.
    * "After (current habit), I will (new habit)."
    * The end of one habit becomes a cue for the next one. The cue should be very specific to be effective.
    * "After work, when you take off your shoes, put on your work out shoes."
    * "On the way down to lunch, do 10 pushups."
  * Environment
    * Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.
      * Put food you want to eat outside the fridge. E.g. bowl of apples on the counter.
    * Every room or place in the room is an "activity zone". If you mix habits in different contexts, the
      easier habits win out. E.g. working while on the couch?You'll always want to watch tv when on the couch.
      Do work at your desk and leisure on the couch; don't mix.
    * Associate your bed with sleeping.
    * The environment becomes the cue for the behaviors you do there. E.g. a gym is full of people working
      out: you'll feel less friction to work out while there.
    * It's easier to build new habits in brand new environments because you're not fighting against old cues
      for your old habits. This might be why "fresh starts" work: move to a new city, become a new person.

* Self control: "make it invisible" (Chapter 7)
  * This is the inversion of "make it obvious."
  * "One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it."
    * E.g. put away the phone while at work.
    * Put away the game console after each use.
    * Hide the snacks so you don't reach for them when craving sugar.
  * If you're addicted to heroine, go to rehab and then move to another city or country. That way you'll avoid
    the bad environmental cues which got you into heroine.

* Make it attractive (Chapter 8)
  * Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Dopamine is released when anticipating a reward, not when
    achieving it. Anticipation drives action.
  * Vices and temptations, like calorie rich foods, video games, hard liquor, and pornography, take cues we
    naturally gravitate towards and engineer them to be super-stimulating, beyond what we would find in
    nature.
  * People of yesteryear play board games, not video games. So the temptation to spend all day on
    entertainment was much easier to resist. There just wasn't that much stimulation. Same with food. Now it's
    easy to get lots of food abundant in salt and sugar. Resisting it taxes the will power, moreso than our
    ancestors had to deal with.
  * He describes a technique called Tim Tatian bundling.
  * Technique: temptation bundling.
    * Pair something you need to do with something you want to do. If I want to watch sports but need to make
      sales calls, allow myself to only watch sports if I make three sales calls.
    * (This sounds fragile to me. Isn't it better to make the thing intrinsically motivating, rather than
      hitching it to something intrinsically motivating?)

* The role of family and friends and making your habits (Chapter 9)

  * The desirable long as one of the strongest the tires will have his people. But it motivates which
    behaviors seem attractive. Basically anything that helps us fit in well be deemed as desirable to us. So
    for instance, if all of your workers were nice suits than you all prefer to wear a nice suit's. If your
    family loves playing chess then you will take up playing chess.
  * All habit-forming products are based on ancient desires. They don't create new desires. All people to have
    the same desires as part of human nature nature: like to be excepted, that's all he post on Instagram.
    Find love and reproduce; that's why we use tinder. Reduce uncertainty; that's why we search on Google and
    do a lot of research
  * You can associate habits with positive outcomes. This doesn't have to be a negative thing like associating
    eating with happiness, leading to over eating. Just the opposite. For example you don't have to get up
    early go to work, and then cook dinner for your family. You get to get up early, you get to go to work,
    you get to cook dinner for your family. Itza reframing which helps you value and enjoy those habits,
    rather than making it feel like burdens.
  * Example the man in the wheelchair doesn't feel confined by his wheelchair, because without that wheelchair
    he would feel confined to the bed all day long.
  * For exercise you can tell yourself that you're not going to work out, but rather you're going to go get
    fast and build endurance.
  * And you can associate the positive feelings to choose themselves. So for instance, you probably mentally
    focused suit yourself when you put on headphones, at work, because in the past you've needed to put on
    headphones every time you need to focus. Another two are linked in your brain.
  * Key idea: you can create a motivation ritual by doing some ritual before an activity that you really
    enjoy. Friends since before petting the dog which makes you happy, take three deep breath and smile. After
    a few times, now that ritual is associated with the happy feeling of putting your dog. So, you can use
    that short ritual in other situations to summon happiness quickly. So if you're stressed at work, three
    deep breaths and then smile.
  * Another example, if you do a ritual before a competitive match, then that ritual begins to take on the
    power to put you in a competitive mindset. And you can use it before games when you're not feeling
    motivated, we can use it at work to feel competitive.
  * Reps help build support for the habit in your brain. "Neurons firing together wire together."

Next chapter
The path followed between two points is the path of least resistance. So if you want to perform behavior that's going to pay off, you should make it as easy as possible to do. So that when you have days of low energy, you're still able to do productive things.
Analogy it's like trying to squeeze water through the hose with a bend in it. You can either put more pressure through the hose, or you can remove thatj bend in the hose. You could remove this friction through environment design.
Analogy think of Toyotas lien design. They added to their production efficiency by shaving off every point of friction in the manufacturing process, and the workers environment. Even to the point of minimizing how much a worker needs to turn to reach their tools.
You can make actions easier by priming the environment. Examples if you want to work out in the morning, set out your workout clothes shoes and water bottle near the door. If you wanna cook breakfast, set out your Pam cooking spray and plates and utensils.
To make it easy to eat healthy, prepare some vegetables and shop fruit and put them in your fridge so they're close at hand when you need a quick snack. Like a hummus plate with vegetables.
This can also be used to prevent bad habits. For instance: if you want to stop watching television then unplug it after each use. Now, also, require that you can say the name of the show you want to watch. This will add enough friction to prevent you from doing mindless surfing.
The greater the friction, the less likely the habit. This can work to your advantage.
Another example if your phone is in another room, you won't be incentivize to check it for trivial updates.
We should ask ourselves: how can we design our world in a way that makes it easy to do what is right, or to put it another way to do the things that will help us meet our goals.

Chapter next: decisive moments
Every day, he has a few moments which are what he calls "decisive moment ". For example when he gets home from work or from school that he decide to pick up the controller and start playing call of duty, or does it begin working on the homework. When you gets home from work and his sees his wife, does it change into his workout clothes so that by default to go for a workout, what is a cop on the couch with her and start watching the office on Netflix. There's a high leverage moments which have an out sized impact on how the rest of your day unfolds.
In someway, we are limited by where our habits lead us. Give them a Tatian of a habit habit determines the set of options that you can choose from later in the day when you're making conscious decisions. You can only choose what to eat for lunch if it's on the menu of the restaurant you're sitting in. So making productive choices in this decisive moments is usually important because it determines your options.

Two minute rule: haven't should be very easy to start. So determine which piece of your habit could be completed in two minutes and make that the habit. It's called a gateway habit. Princetons, if you want to run 5 miles each night, make the habit tying your running shoes. And get you started. And the actions after that maybe very hard, but it is easier to do those hard actions once you have momentum and when she started on the right path via your gate we have it.
Master the skill of showing up. That's what I get we have it will allow you to do consistently.
Another way to think of this is making or rather rich making the first portions of a habit into a ritual. Send those steps to become automatic and easy, and serve as your entryway into the deep focus required for the harder parts of the habit. Imagine if it was completely automatic to get into your running clothes and put on your shoes and start your job. Now after that continuing to jog is much easier and you're spending little energy over coming in our shower, and rather spending all of your energy on the finer points points on the habit, like how you're running.
Commentary the two minute habit exercise is also helpful because it allows us to define easy versions of our habits and so we can always executors before they start feeling like work. In the case of journaling the best way to journal is the general only as much until it starts to feel like work. Rather than drilling as much as you think you need to you to have an accurate record of your day I'll get all of your thoughts on the paper.
This to me to rituals also work because they reinforce the identity that you want to create. If you put your gym is your running shoes on every single day you're going to feel like a runner even if you're only out running for 2 to 5 minutes. And that identity will help you will help reinforce the goal you want to chief in the habit you want to develop.
Another idea: habit shipping. They idea is to break the habit into different milestones a different granularity. And then work on the first two minutes of each of those milestones; work on mastering this first two minutes. For instance to get in shape, the 1st mile stone is to do some work out each day. The next mile stone is to master a particular exercise. The next mile stone is to master your impulses around eating dinner. The next mile stone is to master how do you meal prep. The idea is you focus on just the very first part the first two minutes of that mile stone and leverage the same easy start principal for each phase. I guess it's a form of breaking a habit down and tackling it piece by piece.

Chapter next
Commitment device, or a Ulysses Pat, is a condition you put on yourself to lock in good behavior for your future self, rather than relying on your desires in the moment in the future temperament good behavior. So for instance scheduling dinner at a healthy restaurant after you've worked out. Or asking the waiter to split your meal and a half before they bring it out to you, so you he left. For scheduling an appointment for a presentation of your progress we had a time so that you have a deadline that you can't move.
Rewards come in to flavors: immediate and delayed. Modern society never mind. The problem with that habit is that never mind. People prefer instant gratification. It feels better, and less it's more compelling and desirable. The problem with that have us is that the gratification from them is immediate and the costs are delayed. Likewise, with good habits, usually theCost is immediate, and the benefit is delayed. Like exercise: you have to do all of this pain for work now, to improve your life and wait and look many months or years from now. Over eating: it's feels great to eat good food right now, and you don't have to I know extra weight will take many weeks or months to accumulate.
A good rule of thumb is the better something makes you feel now the more you should question whether it is going to further your long-term goals. It happens that the valuable things in our Cytie usually require long-term gratification. Otherwise everyone would be doing it already.
Research shows that generally people who are better at stealing gratification are healthier more effective get better SAT scores perform better in athletics etc.
Delayed gratification is strongly associated with desirable outcomes in our modern society.
So, you can use this to your advantage by adding some immediate gratification to habits which would otherwise only give you satisfaction once the delay gratification has accumulated. So for instance if you were skipping happy hours so that you can buy a new computer, create a savings account for the computer and transfer money to it every time you skip happy hour. Now there's a nice positive satisfying reward for

Doing this painful activity.
Similarly when you go to exercise Perritte with something that feels like reward. So for instance maybe on the way there you give yourself the let you listen to it you let yourself listen to something really entertaining like Netflix or a podcast. Or afterwards you treat yourself to a workout shake that taste good.
Or you were worried yourself with some free time you can now go ahead and watch some movies or something.
Incentives help you start a habit, identity helps you maintain a habit.

Chapter next: progress
Progress is powerful because it adds some immediate satisfaction to have a switch otherwise our only delay gratification. Examples: sign Feld's habit streak idea using a calendar to cross off days. Moving paper clips from one container to another to measure how many sales calls you've done that day.
Have a streaks are very powerful form of progress because it's a cue to reinforce you to start a habit, and it's a form of progress measurement. So for instance don't break the streak of workouts and you will get fit faster.

Avoiding habits which get D railed
People have this all in but nothing mindset around habits. Either I go to the gym and I go all out, or I missed it because I was busy or had an appointment or was tired or sick. The problem is those zeros eat away at your identity. It's better if you just went to the gym and did a little bit of work even if you don't develop your body because you're not feeling well, because it reaffirms your identity. That's very important, and helps you overcome periods where are you less motivated or you get it wrapped and interrupted because of life circumstances.

Peoples personality is largely shit by their genes. For instance James determine your level of conscientiousness, how neurotic you are, how strongly you respond to rewards etc. Those qualities you can't really change but you can work with them and ensure that the environment you're operating and in the habits you're pursuing leverage your personality. Another words stare your efforts towards habits which are intrinsically easier for you or more enjoyable. Fun idea
Fun idea: find a comparative advantage. What would you think about that is to do the work that pains you less than it pains others. Or gives you more joy more than others.
Look inside yourself and ask yourself what feels natural to you? What makes you most feel alive? That's probably what you should be focusing on. That is where you will get results faster than the average person.
He some point: Scott Adams, the cartoonist of Dilbert, drives a little bit better than average, and can reach out to little bit better than the average person. He's a credit either. But he also has a business background which allows him to write jokes about a specific domain. The intersection of all three of those things is quite rare, and allows him to produce something great. It allows him to keep computer against people that are genetically superior to him and many important ways but not all of the ways.
Another way to think about this is to create a game that leverage is your strength and avoid your weaknesses and play that game, rather than play the game or the sports that everyone else is playing.
Chapter next
Overcoming boredom
The famous coach or coach a famous Olympic Olympic athletes said that beyond the variables of desire and genetics what distinguished the good from the great is the great for able to handle the boredom of training every day.
Working on your habit on the very edge of your capacity, the right difficulty level, it'll keep you most engaged. This is called a Goldilocks rule.
People desire novelty. Makaveli said that people who are accessible desire something new just as much as people who are struggling.
For mastery is a curse. That is why it's engaging to work on challenges which are appropriate for your level of skill.
Very borrow words, like the surprise you get from eating you foods junk foods, or the sexual an hour so you get from dating, it's what people keep people engaged in those activities. So let machines time the reward randomly, which heightens the desire and the enjoyment of the rewardWhen it comes. The best ratio is empirically winning versus losing about 50% of the time. That's the most engaging. And playing a game against others who are at your same skill level guarantees that is about 50-50.
Professionals engage in a habit and both Fairweather and foul weather. The matter what's happening, they find a way to do their wraps.
