  * The four laws of behavior change
    * Make it obvious
    * Make it attractive
    * Make it easy
    * Make it satisfying
  * Systems are better than goals
    * Goals are the outcomes you want. Systems are the process for achieving them. Author advises
      focusing on the system. That's entirely in your control. Winners and losers both have the same
      goals. What separates the gold medal winner from the rest is their system.
    * Goals make your impression of your self-worth binary: either you achieved it or you didn't.
      Systems are more general and adaptable. It's very rare that your life takes the direction that
      your goals sent you. It's healthy and easier to take satisfaction in the progress you've made
      on your system.
  * Changing habits by changing your identity
    * Focusing on "who" (your identity) rather than "what" (outcomes).
    * Declare who you are, then prove it to yourself with small positive changes.
    * This is powerful because it invokes pride.
    * Example identity change statements:
      * "I'm no longer a smoker" is much more powerful than "I'm trying to quit smoking."
      * "I am a good manager who's growing very fast"
      * "I'm not somebody who bites their nails"
      * "I am a person who gets up early to get ahead of my competitors"
    * Incentives help you start a habit. Identity helps you maintain a habit.
  * Avoid zeroes; preserve your identity. Don't have an all or nothing mindset about your habit.
    Don't ever cancel it: instead, just do a little bit of it that day. Otherwise it erodes your
    identity. Maintaining the streak strengthens your identity.
  * Gateway habits ("two minute rule"): the beginning ritual of a habit should be doable in two
    minutes. If you want to run 5 miles, start by tying your running shoes. Even if step 2 is hard,
    the momentum makes it much easier to do, especially with repetition. The gateway habit "sets you
    on the path" and it's uncomfortable to abandon once you're on the path.
    * Imagine if it was easy and completely automatic to get into your running clothes and put on
      your shoes and start your jog. Now after that part, continuing the jog is much easier and
      you're spending little energy overcoming inertia in the shower. Instead, you're spending all
      of your energy on the finer points points on the habit, like how fast you're running.
    * I think this works because the gateway ritual reinforces the identity that you want to create.
      If you put your gym shoes on every day, then you're going to feel like a runner even if you're
      only out there running for 5 minutes. That identity will help the habit grow.
  * Prepare the environment to make it easier in the moment to do the productive thing.
    * E.g. set out your workout clothes the night before. Put them on by default when you get home
      from work. Determine your weekend game plan the night before, and stock it with enriching
      activities. Put healthy food on the island to snack on.
    * Make good habits more obvious (implementation intentions) and bad habits invisible (hide the
      snacks; they're not there).
  * Decisive moments (Chap 13)
    * Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. E.g. when we get
      home from school, do we pick up the controller, or get out in front of our homework? These
      choices determine your future option set later that evening.
  * Attach an immediate gratification to a habit that only has delayed gratification. Like a
    celebratory ritual/indulgence when you enter the gym, or the joy of incrementing the streak
    counter.
  * Observation: there are many tools for habits. For the hardest or most important habits that I
    want, I should carefully design how to strongly execute on them.

* Time magnifies habits; systems are better than goals (chap 1)
  * Time magnifies habits
    * A successful life is built up of the accumulation of small habits. Just a small change in
      trajectory will send you to a vastly different destination over the course of your life.
    * We can't normally see the impact of small changes because of how long it takes for them to
      affect change. Think about dieting: a few calories on a given day will not seem to affect your
      results, and so you abandon the diet. But over long periods of time, the diet transforms your
      body composition.
    * Your outcomes are a lagging indicator of your habits. Your body weight is an indicator of your
      diet. Your health a lagging indicator of your exercise. Your knowledge is a lagging indicator
      of your rate of learning.
    * Time magnifies the effect of your habits: whatever you feed it, that's what it will magnify.
      So if you complete one more task each day, or make it to the gym one more time each week, that
      will result in a huge amount of completed tasks or additional strength by the end of the year.
  * Systems are better than goals
    * Goals are the outcomes you want. Systems are the process for achieving them. Author advises
      focusing on the system. That's entirely in your control. Winners and losers both have the same
      goals. What separates the gold medal winner from the rest is their system.
    * Goals make your impression of your self-worth binary: either you achieved it or you didn't.
      Systems are more general and adaptable. It's very rare that your life takes the direction that
      your goals sent you. It's healthy and easier to take satisfaction in the progress you've made
      on your system.
    * True long-term thinking is not about goals, but commitment to and enjoyment in the refinement
      the process.

* Changing habits by changing your identity (chap 2)
  * Focusing on "who" (your identity) rather than "what" (outcomes).
  * Declare who you are, then prove it to yourself with small positive changes.
  * Being consistent with your identity is strong intrinsic motivation.
  * Example identity change statements:
    * "I'm no longer a smoker" is much more powerful than "I'm trying to quit smoking."
    * "I am a good manager who's growing very fast"
    * "I'm not somebody who bites their nails"
    * "I am a person who gets up early to get ahead of my competitors"
  * Why does it work? Your identity invokes your pride.
    * If you are ripped, you are not the kind of person who misses workouts.
    * If you are not a smoker, you are not the kind of person tempted by a cigarette.
  * Identities can also be harmful: I'm not good with names; I'm not good at math.
  * How to start with an outcome, and reframe it as an identity change
    * Declare the goal, and think of what kind of person could achieve that goal.
    * "What kind of person could have six pack abs? Healthy person." Then you can focus on becoming
      that person, and not just on the outcome.

* The four laws of behavior change (chap 3)
  * Make it obvious
  * Make it attractive
  * Make it easy
  * Make it satisfying

* Making your habits more obvious your habits (chap 4)
  * Negative habits
    * Habits are automatic. That makes it hard to tune negative ones.
    * Increase awareness by calling them out loud when you do them. Once they're top of mind
      (obvious), they can be changed.
    * Tool: point and call out loud when you notice a bad habit in action. E.g. you're eating
      against your goals... don't judge, but study and become aware of how you feel and why you're
      reaching for that cooking, and dialogue: "I'm about to have this cookie even though I don't
      need it."

* Make it obvious (chap 5, 6)
  * Implementation intentions: when you set a goal for yourself, specifically describe the time and
    place and how you will do the goal. This prepares your mind for the activity and gives you a cue
    to start it, so there's less resistance to doing it.
  * Habit stacking:
    * Use this implementation intention to link a new habit onto an existing habit.
    * "After (current habit), I will (new habit)."
    * The end of one habit becomes a cue for the next one. The cue should be very specific to be
      effective.
    * "After work, when you take off your shoes, put on your work out shoes."
    * "On the way down to lunch, do 10 push ups."
  * Environment
    * Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.
      * Put food you want to eat outside the fridge. E.g. bowl of apples on the counter.
    * Every room or place in the room is an "activity zone". If you mix habits in different
      contexts, the easier habits win out. E.g. working while on the couch?You'll always want to
      watch tv when on the couch. Do work at your desk and leisure on the couch; don't mix.
    * Associate your bed with sleeping.
    * The environment becomes the cue for the behaviors you do there. E.g. a gym is full of people
      working out: you'll feel less friction to work out while there.
    * It's easier to build new habits in brand new environments because you're not fighting against
      old cues for your old habits. This might be why "fresh starts" work: move to a new city,
      become a new person.

* Self control: "make it invisible" (chap 7)
  * This is the inversion of "make it obvious."
  * "One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that
    causes it."
    * E.g. put away the phone while at work.
    * Put away the game console after each use.
    * Hide the snacks so you don't reach for them when craving sugar.
  * If you're addicted to heroine, go to rehab and then move to another city or country. That way
    you'll avoid the bad environmental cues which got you into heroine.

* Make it attractive (chap 8)
  * Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Dopamine is released when anticipating a reward, not
    when achieving it. Anticipation drives action.
  * Vices and temptations, like calorie rich foods, video games, hard liquor, and pornography, take
    cues we naturally gravitate towards and engineer them to be super-stimulating, beyond what we
    would find in nature.
  * People of yesteryear played board games, not video games. So the temptation to spend all day on
    entertainment was much easier to resist. There just wasn't that much stimulation. Same with
    food. Now it's easy to get lots of food abundant in salt and sugar. Resisting it taxes the will
    power, more so than our ancestors had to deal with.
  * Technique: temptation bundling
    * Pair something you need to do with something you want to do. If I want to watch sports but
      need to make sales calls, allow myself to only watch sports if I make three sales calls.
    * (This sounds fragile to me. Isn't it better to make the thing intrinsically motivating, rather
      than hitching it to something intrinsically motivating?)

* The role of family and friends and making your habits (chap 9)
  * Reframing
    * The man in the wheelchair doesn't feel confined by his wheelchair, because without that
      wheelchair he would feel confined to the bed all day long.
    * Tell yourself that you're not going to work out, but rather you're going to go get fast and
      build endurance.
  * Reps help build support for the habit in your brain. "Neurons firing together wire together."

* Law of least effort (chap 12)
  * Make the desired behavior as easy as possible to do: your body will follow the line of least
    resistance, especially when your energy is low.
  * Analogy it's like trying to squeeze water through the hose with a bend in it. You can either put
    more pressure through the hose, or you can remove the bend in the hose.
  * You could remove this friction through environment design.
    * Analogy think of Toyota's line design. They added to their production efficiency by shaving
      off every point of friction in the manufacturing process and the workers' environment. Even to
      the point of minimizing how much a worker needs to turn to reach their tools.
  * Priming the environment: adding and removing friction
    * Priming the environment can make an action easier, or a bad habit harder.
    * If you want to work out in the morning, set out your workout clothes, shoes, and water bottle
      near the door.
    * If you want to cook breakfast, set out your cooking spray and plates and utensils.
    * To make it easy to eat healthy, prepare some vegetables and fruit and put them in your fridge
      so they're close at hand when you need a quick snack. Like a hummus plate with vegetables.
    * If you want to stop watching television then unplug it after each use. Now, also, require that
      you can say the name of the show you want to watch. This will add enough friction to prevent
      you from doing mindless surfing.
  * The greater the friction, the less likely the habit. This can work to your advantage.
  * Another example if your phone is in another room, you won't be incentivize to check it for
    trivial updates.
  * We should ask ourselves: how can we design our world in a way that makes it easy to do the the
    thing that will help us meet our goals?

* Decisive moments (Chap 13)
  * Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact.
  * Examples
    * When we get home from work school, do we decide to pick up the controller and start playing
      call of duty, or begin working on the homework to get ahead of it?
    * When we get home from work and see our wife, do we change into our workout clothes so that by
      default we are headed for a workout, or do we plop on the couch with her and start watching
      Netflix?
  * The choices that are forks in the road are the most important. They determine your option set
    for later in the day.
    * You can only choose what to eat for lunch if it's on the menu of the restaurant you're sitting
      in. So if you haven't chosen to guide yourself toward a healthy meal, you won't have one, even
      if you want one.
  * Gateway habits ("two minute rule"): the beginning ritual of a habit should be doable in two
    minutes. If you want to run 5 miles, start by tying your running shoes. Even if step 2 is hard,
    the momentum makes it much easier to do, especially with repetition. The gateway habit "sets you
    on the path" and it's uncomfortable to abandon once you're on the path.
    * Imagine if it was easy and completely automatic to get into your running clothes and put on
      your shoes and start your jog. Now after that part, continuing the jog is much easier and
      you're spending little energy overcoming inertia in the shower. Instead, you're spending all
      of your energy on the finer points points on the habit, like how fast you're running.
    * I think this works because the gateway ritual reinforces the identity that you want to create.
      If you put your gym shoes on every day, then you're going to feel like a runner even if you're
      only out there running for 5 minutes. That identity will help the habit grow.
    * Master the skill of showing up. That's what I get we have it will allow you to do
      consistently.
    * Find a way to commit to the easy part of the habit. E.g. journaling: the best way to start is
      to set low expectations and get one thought down, rather than believing you have to elegantly
      chronicle every part of the day. From the one thought will flow additional journals.
  * Related: habit milestoning
    * The idea is to break the habit into granular milestones, and then work on the first two
      minutes of each of those milestones. For example, to get in shape:
        * 1st milestone is to do some work out each day.
        * 2nd is to master a particular exercise.
        * 3rd is to master your impulses around eating dinner.
        * 4th is to master how do you meal prep.
    * The idea is you focus on just the very first part the first two minutes of that mile stone and
      leverage the same easy start/ gateway principal for each phase.

* Commitment devices (chap 14)
  * Commitment device, or a Ulysses Pat
    * A condition you put on yourself in to lock in good behavior for your future self, rather than
    relying on your desires and temperament in a future moment.
    * Examples
      * Scheduling dinner at a healthy restaurant after you've worked out.
      * Asking the waiter to split your meal in half before they bring it out to you.
      * Scheduling an appointment to present your project's progress, so you have a immovable
        deadline to target.

* Make it satisfying (chap 15)
  * Rewards come in to flavors: immediate and delayed.
    * For good habits, the cost is immediate and the reward is delayed. Like exercise.
    * For bad habits, it's the opposite. Gratification comes immediately, and then regret later.
      Like overeating.
    * A good rule of thumb: the better something makes you feel now the more you should question
      whether it is going to further your long-term goals. The valuable things in life usually
      require long-delayed gratification. Otherwise everyone would be doing it already.
      * Research shows that generally people who are better at delaying gratification are healthier,
        more effective, get better SAT scores, perform better in athletics.
    * Use this to your advantage by adding some immediate gratification to habits which have
      long-delayed rewards. Examples:
      * If you were skipping happy hours so that you can buy a new computer, create a savings
        account for the computer and transfer money to it every time you skip happy hour. Now
        there's satisfying reward attached to it.
      * If you're exercising, attach some indulgence to it, like listening to a fun podcast on the
        way there, or watch some TV show that you like but restrict outside of exercising. Or you
        reward yourself with an hour of free time post-workout where you can watch a movie.
  * Incentives help you start a habit. Identity helps you maintain a habit.

* Progress (chap 16)
  * Progress is powerful because it adds some immediate satisfaction. E.g. Seinfeld habit streak.
    * Moving paper clips from one container to another to measure how many sales calls you've done
      that day.
  * Avoid zeroes; preserve your identity
    * People have this "all or nothing" mindset around habits: either I go to the gym and go all
      out, or I missed it because I was busy, had an appointment, was tired. The problem is those
      zeroes eat away at your identity. It's better to just get to the gym and do a little bit of
      work, even if it's soft/shallow, because it reaffirms your identity. "I'm the kind of person
      that's at the gym, even if he's feeling sick."
    * This helps you overcome periods where you would otherwise get demotivated because you become
      wrapped up in life's circumstances.

* Comparative advantage (chap 18)
  * Look inside yourself and ask yourself what feels natural to you? What makes you most feel alive?
    That's probably what you should be focusing on. That is where you will get results faster than
    the average person.
  * Another way to think about this is to create a game that leverage is your strength and avoid
    your weaknesses and play that game, rather than play the game or the sports that everyone else
    is playing.
  * Dilbert: the intersection of drawing and SWE background.

* Goldilocks rule of overcoming boredom (chap 19)
  * If a habit or contest is too easy, you're bored. Too hard and you'll fail and quit.
  * The best empirical ratio for winning versus losing about 50% of the time. That's the most
    engaging. And playing a game against others who are at your same skill level guarantees that is
    about 50-50.
  * Working on your habit on the very edge of your capacity, the right difficulty level, it'll keep
    you most engaged. This is called a Goldilocks rule.
  * Famous coach of Olympic athletes said that beyond the variables of desire and genetics what
    distinguished the good from the great is the great for able to handle the boredom of training
    every day.
  * Professionals engage in a habit and both fair weather and foul weather. No matter what's
    happening, they find a way to do their reps.

* Conclusion
  * "The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop
    paying attention to little errors."
  * "Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery"
  * Edition of water to have us to your system are going to move the needle. The magic is that they
    add up like grains of sand on the scale eventually you're so the scales are heavy. His opinion
    the pursuit in life is to feel the best system that you're living with him. That system is where
    your habits reside. Building that system and optimizing Ellis and Ellis pursuits.
  * This book is a set of tools that can be used to endlessly optimize habits. At every point in
    time a habit can use some improvement. What's the next issue with the habit to iterate on? When
    you don't feel like sticking with the habit anymore, than you need to make it more attractive.
    When you're forgetting about it, make it more obvious. And so on.
