  * "Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also
    need to stay small enough so that you actually can."
  * "Even more important than nimbleness, small size affords space to think."
  * "When a big company makes an offer to acquire a successful startup, it almost always offers too much or
    too little: founders only sell when they have no more concrete visions for the company, in which case the
    acquirer probably overpaid; definite founders with robust plans don't sell, which means the offer wasn't
    high enough."
* Preface
  * 0 to 1 is a new innovation. 1 to n is "adding more of something familiar."
  * "The single most powerful pattern I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected
    places, and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas."
  * "A concrete formula for innovation cannot exist."
* The challenge of the future (chap 1)
  * Vertical vs. horizontal progress (doing new things vs. copying things that work)
    * "If you take one typewriter and build 100, you have made horizontal progress. If you have a typewriter
      and build a word processor, you have made vertical progress.
    * Globalization is an example of horizontal progress.
  * "People tend to believe the future is defined by globalization, but technology will matter more."
  * "Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also
    need to stay small enough so that you actually can."
  * "Positively defined a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a
    different future."
  * "Even more important than nimbleness, small size affords space to think."
* Party like it's 1999 (chap 2)
  * (How much of our  best practices are shaped by mistaken reactions ot the past? E.g. lean startup,
    unambitious incremental progress, avoiding the creation of new markets?)
  * Don't be afraid to question or abandon the current wisdom
    * "To build the next generation of companies, we must abandon the dogmas created after the crash."
* All happy companies are different (chap 3)
  * Monopolies are a more productive model for innovation.
  * All failed businesses are alike in that they failed to escape competition.
  * A valuable company creates lots of value in the world in dollars (X), but also captures it (Y).
    * Airlines vs. Google: both delivered huge value, but Google captured much more of the value it created
      (has a larger Y).
  * A good monopoly: a company so good that no other firm can offer a close substitute.
    * This definition excludes anti-competitive bullies, and state-sponsored companies.
  * Businesses are closer to the extremes (monopolies vs. fully arbitraged by competitors) than we typically
    perceive.
    * This is because no company wants to be perceived as a monopoly (to avoid antitrust), or perceived as a
      commodity.
  * Monopoly lies: redefining their core market to be much larger, to appear less dominant.
  * Competitive lies: define a market unrealistically narrowly, to have a viable path to dominance.
  * "Non-monopolies exaggerate their distinction by defining their market as the intersection of various small
    markets."
  * "Monopolists, by contrast, disguise their monopoly by framing their market as the union of several large
    markets."
  * "The competitive ecosystem pushes people toward ruthlessness or death. A monopoly like Google is
    different. Since it doesn't have to worry about competing with anyone, it has wider latitude to care about
    its workers, its products, and its impact on the wider world."
  * "Only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly
    profits."
  * I.e. perfectly competitive businesses do not have surplus to innovate or focus on research. The reward of
    a decade of monopoly profits provides incentive to innovate.
  * "Creative monopolists give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories of abundance to the
    world. Creative monopolies aren't just good for the rest of society; they're powerful engines for making
    it better."
  * In a static market, monopolies collect rent at the expense of consumers. But in the real world they are
    innovating and creating new markets.
  * "The history of progress is a history of better monopoly businesses replacing incumbents."
  * "In the real world outside economic theory, every business is successful exactly to the extent that it
    does something others cannot."
  * "All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed
    companies are the same: they failed to escape competition."
* The ideology of competition (chap 4)
  * "Creative monopoly means new products that benefit everybody and sustainable profits for the creator."
  * "Elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat
    their dreams out of them. Higher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get
    stuck in fierce rivalries with equally smart peers over conventional careers like management consulting
    and investment banking."
* Last mover advantage (chap 5)
  * You want to dominate a market for years, collecting monopoly profits. To do so you don't necessarily need
    to be first; that's a tactic. You do need to be the last significant innovation.
  * "The value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future."
    * Twitter is more valuable than Times because Twitter has a future where it will capture monopoly profits
      for many years. Times doesn't.
  * For companies which will endure (Paypal, LinkedIn) high multiples are justified because most of the cash
    flows will occur in the future.
  * "For a company to valuable it must grow and endure, but many entrepreneurs focus only on short-term
    growth. They have an excuse: growth is easy to measure, but durability isn't."
  * Since durability is hard to estimate and measure, we instead use growth rate to benchmark a business. But
    that's misleading. Groupon and Zynga had high growth rates as they went public.
  * Characteristics of a monopoly
    * Proprietary technology
      * To qualify, you must be 10x better.
      * Examples: Google search, Paypal, Apple iPod.
      * Ways to get 10x: solve a problem for the first time; scale the solution 10x; be an integrated
        solution.
      * (Believes integrated solutions are an under-tapped way to achieve this).
    * Network effects
      * Developer ecosystem
      * You can achieve this by bootstrapping a two-sided network or marketplace by starting with a niche.
        Facebook and Harvard.
    * Economies of scale
      * Service businesses lack this, and so it's hard for them to become monopolies.
    * Branding
      * E.g. Apple: materials, stores, Jobs' halo, design. Built on top of a lot of substance.
  * Jobs "slashed product lines to focus on the handful of opportunities for 10x improvement."
  * To start, monopolize a tiny (but existent) market
    * "the perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and
      served by few or no competitors."
    * 1% market penetration isn't a monopoly position
    * "This is why it's always a red flag when entrepreneurs talk about getting 1% of a $100 billion market."
  * Then, scale up: conquer adjacent markets
    * Amazon: vision was to dominate online retail, and they started with books.
  * Don't disrupt
    * The act of creation of a new product or market is relatively more important than upending an existing
      market. "Disruption" invites a competitive battle.
    * "Indeed, if your company can be summed up by its opposition to already existing firms, it can't be
      completely new and it's probably not going to become a monopoly."
    * Paypal wasn't positioned to be disruptive; they didn't want to invite a fight with Visa, even though
      they were building in that direction.
* You are not a lottery ticket (chap 6)
  * Believe in a definite rather than indefinite future. One that you will need to bring about with the work
    of your hands. THis encourages ambition, proactivity, and a mindset of hard work.
  * "From the Renaissance and the Enlightenment to the mid-20th century, luck was something to be mastered,
    dominated, and controlled."
    * "Focus on cause and effect."
  * "When people lack concrete plans to carry out, they use formal rules to assemble a portfolio of various
    options", rather than bringing about a definite vision.
  * "By the time a student gets to college, he's spent a decade curating a bewilderingly diverse resume to
    prepare for a completely unknowable future. Come what may, he's ready -- for nothing in particular."
  * "A definite view, by contrast, favors firm convictions. Instead of pursuing many-sided mediocrity and
    calling it 'well-roundedness,' a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it."
  * Mindset
    * Definite: "the future will likely be X, and we can make it so."
    * Indefinite: "the future is unknown; we'll react when it arrives."
  * Categorizing recent history
    * Definite and optimistic: US, 1950s-1960s (space age)
    * Indefinite and optimistic: US, 1982-present
    * Definite and pessimistic: China, present
    * Indefinite and pessimistic: Europe, present
  * (Would definite/indefinite be better framed as proactive vs. reactive?)
  * Indefinite pessimism: probably my view of Liftoff in its mature phase, as the space consolidates and Apple
    rolls out ATT. The employees and investors are crying out for a vision that delivers definite optimism. If
    Apple ATT materializes, then it becomes definite pessimism.
  * "To a definite optimist, the future will be better than the present if he plans and works to make it
    better."
    * A simple if-then mental model.
  * Indefinite optimism
    * Thiel believes this is the dominant American viewpoint, for the boomers.
    * It encourages tracked careers, and incremental improvement of what we have today.
  * "Instead of working for years to build a new product, indefinite optimists rearrange already-invented
    ones. Bankers make money by rearranging the capital structures of already existing companies. Lawyers
    resolve disputes over old things or help other people structure their affairs."
    * (So depressing)
  * "Finance epitomizes indefinite thinking because it's the only way to make money when you have no idea how
    to create wealth."
  * Under indefinite optimism, the government's role is to provide insurance to the citizens, rather than
    coordinating ambitious plans to engineer material improvements to the nation.
  * "In business, arguing over process has become a way to endlessly defer making concrete plans for a better
    future."
  * He slams biotech startups as making poor progress due to many factors, but most of all an indefinite
    attitude -- "See what sticks; try things at random."
  * "U.S. companies are letting cash pile up on their balance sheets without investing in new projects because
    they don't have any concrete plans for the future."
  * "Would-be entrepreneurs are told that nothing can be known in advance: we're supposed to listen to what
    customers say they want, make nothing more than a 'minimum viable product,' and iterate our way to
    success."
  * Apple is an inspiration because of their ambitious multi-year plans, not their diligent iteration or
    aesthetic design.
  * "When a big company makes an offer to acquire a successful startup, it almost always offers too much or
    too little: founders only sell when they have no more concrete visions for the company, in which case the
    acquirer probably overpaid; definite founders with robust plans don't sell, which means the offer wasn't
    high enough."
  * On Facebook rejecting Yahoo's $1B offer, "a business with a good definite plan will always be underrated
    in a world where people see the future as random."
  * "We have to find our way back to a definite future, and the Western world needs nothing short of a
    cultural revolution to do it."
* Follow the money (the power law) (chap 7)
  * Exponential growth creates severely unequal distributions.
  * In VC, startups, and potentially elsewhere, this means some companies and markets make up the vast
    majority of value. Facebook, Google, Apple.
  * People don't think or observe in power law terms, and make irrational decisions because of it.
  * "Since nobody wants to give up on an investment, VCs usually spend even more time on the most problematic
    companies than they do on the most obviously successful."
    * But this means the firm focuses on the average portfolio companies, which is a poor investment if only
      one or two of the investments have the potential to make the fun.
  * Because VC returns are based on funding a company in the head of a power law, diversification is not a
    useful goal for VC funds.
  * "Everybody who passes through the American school system learns not to think in power law terms. Every
    high school course period lasts 45 minutes whatever the subject. Every student proceeds at a similar pace.
    At college, model students obsessively hedge their futures by assembling a suite of exotic and minor
    skills."
  * "You can't trust a world that denies the power law to accurately frame your decisions for you, so what's
    most important is rarely obvious."
* Secrets (ideas) (chap 8)
  * This chapter is about modeling innovation as "secrets" that you can discover.
  * "What valuable company is nobody building?"
  * Argues that modern society believes there are no "hard secrets" left. There are no blank spaces on the
    map.
  * "Anyone who might have had the ambition to look for a secret will first ask himself: if it were possible
    to discover something new, wouldn't someone from the faceless global talent pool of smarter and more
    creative people have found it already? This voice of doubt can dissuade people from even starting to look
    for secrets in a world that seems too big a place for any individual to contribute something unique."
    * People think, the world is flat, and the good secrets have already been discovered.
  * There are many secrets. Just dream of all that we don't have today -- you'll find ideas like Uber, Airbnb.
  * "The best place to look for secrets is where no one else is looking" -- not within established majors.
* Foundations (about founding logistics) (chap 9)
  * Founders: have a strong prehistory.
  * Three people is an ideal-sized board.
  * On the bus or off the bus -- about consultants: "Anyone who doesn't own stock options or draw a regular
    salary from your company is fundamentally misaligned. At the margin, they'll be biased to claim value in
    the near term, not help you create more in the future. That's why hiring consultants doesn't work."
  * "Cash-poor executives" aligns motivations to grow the company at all costs.
  * "High cash compensation teaches workers to claim value from the company as it already exists instead of
    investing their time to create new value in the future."
  * "Equity is the one form of compensation that can effectively orient people toward creating value in the
    future."
  * "Anyone who prefers owning a part of your company to being paid in cash reveals a rpeference for the long
    term and a commitment to increasing your company's value in the future. Equity can't create perfect
    incentives, but it's the best way for a founder to keep everyone in the company broadly aligned."
