  * "Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also
    need to stay small enough so that you actually can."
  * "Even more important than nimbleness, small size affords space to think."
* Preface
  * 0 to 1 is a new innovation. 1 to n is "adding more of something familiar."
  * "The single most powerful pattern I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected
    places, and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas."
  * "A concrete formula for innovation cannot exist."
* The challenge of the future (chap 1)
  * Vertical vs. horizontal progress (doing new things vs. copying things that work)
    * "If you take one typewriter and build 100, you have made horizontal progress. If you have a typewriter
      and build a word processor, you have made vertical progress.
    * Globalization is an example of horizontal progress.
  * "People tend to believe the future is defined by globalization, but technology will matter more."
  * "Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also
    need to stay small enough so that you actually can."
  * "Positively defined a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a
    different future."
  * "Even more important than nimbleness, small size affords space to think."
* Party like it's 1999 (chap 2)
  * (How much of our  best practices are shaped by mistaken reactions ot the past? E.g. lean startup,
    unambitious incremental progress, avoiding the creation of new markets?)
  * Don't be afraid to question or abandon the current wisdom
    * "To build the next generation of companies, we must abandon the dogmas created after the crash."
* All happy companies are different (chap 3)
  * Monopolies are a more productive model for innovation.
  * All failed businesses are alike in that they failed to escape competition.
  * A valuable company creates lots of value in the world in dollars (X), but also captures it (Y).
    * Airlines vs. Google: both delivered huge value, but Google captured much more of the value it created
      (has a larger Y).
  * A good monopoly: a company so good that no other firm can offer a close substitute.
    * This definition excludes anti-competitive bullies, and state-sponsored companies.
  * Businesses are closer to the extremes (monopolies vs. fully arbitraged by competitors) than we typically
    perceive.
    * This is because no company wants to be perceived as a monopoly (to avoid antitrust), or perceived as a
      commodity.
  * Monopoly lies: redefining their core market to be much larger, to appear less dominant.
  * Competitive lies: define a market unrealistically narrowly, to have a viable path to dominance.
  * "Non-monopolies exaggerate their distinction by defining their market as the intersection of various small
    markets."
  * "Monopolists, by contrast, disguise their monopoly by framing their market as the union of several large
    markets."
  * "The competitive ecosystem pushes people toward ruthlessness or death. A monopoly like Google is
    different. Since it doesn't have to worry about competing with anyone, it has wider latitude to care about
    its workers, its products, and its impact on the wider world."
  * "Only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival: monopoly
    profits."
  * I.e. perfectly competitive businesses do not have surplus to innovate or focus on research. The reward of
    a decade of monopoly profits provides incentive to innovate.
  * "Creative monopolists give customers more choices by adding entirely new categories of abundance to the
    world. Creative monopolies aren't just good for the rest of society; they're powerful engines for making
    it better."
  * In a static market, monopolies collect rent at the expense of consumers. But in the real world they are
    innovating and creating new markets.
  * "The history of progress is a history of better monopoly businesses replacing incumbents."
  * "In the real world outside economic theory, every business is successful exactly to the extent that it
    does something others cannot."
  * "All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed
    companies are the same: they failed to escape competition."
* The ideology of competition (chap 4)
  * "Creative monopoly means new products that benefit everybody and sustainable profits for the creator."
  * "Elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat
    their dreams out of them. Higher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get
    stuck in fierce rivalries with equally smart peers over conventional careers like management consulting
    and investment banking."
* Last mover advantage (chap 5)
  * You want to dominate a market for years, collecting monopoly profits. To do so you don't necessarily need
    to be first; that's a tactic. You do need to be the last significant innovation.
  * "The value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future."
    * Twitter is more valuable than Times because Twitter has a future where it will capture monopoly profits
      for many years. Times doesn't.
  * For companies which will endure (Paypal, LinkedIn) high multiples are justified because most of the cash
    flows will occur in the future.
  * "For a company to valuable it must grow and endure, but many entrepreneurs focus only on short-term
    growth. They have an excuse: growth is easy to measure, but durability isn't."
  * Since durability is hard to estimate and measure, we instead use growth rate to benchmark a business. But
    that's misleading. Groupon and Zynga had high growth rates as they went public.
  * Characteristics of a monopoly
    * Proprietary technology
      * To qualify, you must be 10x better.
      * Examples: Google search, Paypal, Apple iPod.
      * Ways to get 10x: solve a problem for the first time; scale the solution 10x; be an integrated
        solution.
      * (Believes integrated solutions are an under-tapped way to achieve this).
    * Network effects
      * Developer ecosystem
      * You can achieve this by bootstrapping a two-sided network or marketplace by starting with a niche.
        Facebook and Harvard.
    * Economies of scale
      * Service businesses lack this, and so it's hard for them to become monopolies.
    * Branding
      * E.g. Apple: materials, stores, Jobs' halo, design. Built on top of a lot of substance.
  * Jobs "slashed product lines to focus on the handful of opportunities for 10x improvement."
  * To start, monopolize a tiny (but existent) market
    * "the perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and
      served by few or no competitors."
    * 1% market penetration isn't a monopoly position
    * "This is why it's always a red flag when entrepreneurs talk about getting 1% of a $100 billion market."
  * Then, scale up: conquer adjacent markets
    * Amazon: vision was to dominate online retail, and they started with books.
  * Don't disrupt
    * The act of creation of a new product or market is relatively more important than upending an existing
      market. "Disruption" invites a competitive battle.
    * "Indeed, if your company can be summed up by its opposition to already existing firms, it can't be
      completely new and it's probably not going to become a monopoly."
    * Paypal wasn't positioned to be disruptive; they didn't want to invite a fight with Visa, even though
      they were building in that direction.
