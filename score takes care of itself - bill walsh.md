* The "Standard of Performance" (SOP)
  * The bar Bill precisely defined for every position in his org.
  * Aim for Process -- a standard of performance -- which is absolute and can be perfect, rather than a
    result, which is high variance and relative to others.
    * A win/loss record is distracting. Focus on what you can control, and the score will take care of itself.
  * This Standard included universal principles, ~15 of them, e.g.
    * Treat others with respect, and respect their work
    * Honor the direct connection between details and improvement
    * Put the team before yourself
    * Recognize that every success and failure isn't a result of one person, but the team.
    * Seek poise in myself and those I lead
* Cultural pride
  * Everyone in the org built a strong sense of the org. Anything with the logo on it was treated with
    respect. Bill's goal was to have the same sentiment of the army — you can't let down your fellow soldier.
  * While you were a 49er, you were expected to give it your all, and conduct yourself like a 49er, even if in
    the future you will switch teams to optimize for your career development.
* Performing under pressing
  * He didn't use a "try harder" exhortation for big games. He didn't pump up the players with hype, because
    it would be like blowing too much air into a balloon. Their nerves would get to them.
  * Instead he focused on the fundamentals, the Standard of Performance. That allowed them to rely on their
    preparation and focus on that. A super bowl game became business as usual.
  * Release the steam — pressure — in high stress situations. Bill wore a bell hop uniform and slyly took the
    bags of his team when they arrived in town for their first super bowl.
* West coast offense
  * He invented the shirt pass offense because he had to work with limited assets. He didn't have a QB with a
    gun. Constraints bred creativity. "What assets are you not using?"
  * Respect the past but don't cling to it. Be bold.
* People, priorities, and performance
  * Seek character. Avoid characters
    * Big ego isn't a problem. Every high performer will have a big ego. It just means self confidence and
      self assurance. Egotism is a problem. It’s an inflated sense of value. He would sit down with players he
      saw
* Scripting / contingency planning
  * This ensures you are fully in control of every percentage of the Game that’s not determined by luck, but
    by decisions.
  * You can’t perform at a high level when under the stress of a new, high-stakes situation. So plan for all
    of the decision branches ahead of time. were becoming egotistic, and level set and show how it’s affecting
    their success.
* Fighting off success disease
  * Be a 1-point underdog -- no matter the opponent, you're behind and need to outwork them for victory. This
    keeps the team hungry.
* Dance of the doomed
  * When you lose a match, you must not let your competitor look at you and see that they've broken your
    spirit. You must lose with class and honor, go down fighting. That will maintain your spirit for the next
    battle.
* "Have no enemies"
  * Hostile relationships are toxic and expensive. In a business as public as football, you have an infinite
    number of potential enemies and critics. You must not engage with them, but instead be neutral or cordial
    to everyone you interact with, even if they’re being hostile to you. Save those resources for other
    battles.
  * Some of those enemies you avoid by making good gestures will become allies and supporters.
* Bill Walsh's reflections on his life
  * Well executed football was deeply pleasing to him aesthetically. The score was less important than how it
    was achieved. Only good football brought him satisfaction, even if bad football brought him a win.
  * He has an insatiable desire to break every problem down and do it better.
  * "Every problem can be solved by breaking it down and specifying the solution as a list"
  * An org of character attracts people of character. A culture where people can get screwed becomes known
    outside of the org. E.g. his story of how his boss at Cincinnati badmouthed him to scouts calling on him
    for head coach positions.
  * Surprise is not a strategy. It's usually the default when you haven't done sufficient prep or lack
    strategy. It’s over glorified by the media. What you want is well jones crushing strategically sound
    execution.
  * His biggest flaw, he thinks, was his inability to delegate more aggressively and build trust in others. He
    wanted to do it all himself, at least on the offense. Only then he could trust that it would get done. He
    had strong self confidence.
  * But this didn't scale. He experienced exhaustion. Didn't figure this out until years after the 49ers
  * Got burned out. Was so focused on perfection that eventually he got no joy from wins, and was only driven
    by the fear of eventually losing.
  * Avoiding burnout:
    * Have someone to confide in. May not be your family if they’re not equipped to understand the magnitude
      of your responsibility Delegate abundantly. Don’t die of thirst.
    * Make your goal the inputs, not the output. No one can control the final outcome. Too many variables
