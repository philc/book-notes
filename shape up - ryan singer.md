    * "Once we think we have a solution, we take a hard look at it to find holes or unanswered questions that
      could trip up the team. We amend the solution, cut things out of it, or specify details at certain
      tricky spots to prevent the team from getting stuck or wasting time."

  * On backlogs: they don't use them. People track things their own way in independent lists, and every six
    weeks, whatever is shaped, fresh, and urgent/important is brought up by team members to the "betting
    table" to be considered for the upcoming cycle.

* Intro
  * Six week cycles
    * "Six weeks is long enough to build something meaningful start-to-finish and short enough that everyone
      can feel the deadline looming from the start, so they use the time wisely."
  * Shaping the work
    * A small senior team works in parallel to the "cycle team" (the team working on the cycle/sprint) to
      shape and vet the next set of bets. It's the "pre-work."
  * Targeting risk
    * The greatest risk is not shipping on time.
    * "This book is about the risk of getting stuck, the risk of getting bogged down with last quarter's work,
      wasting time on unexpected problems, and not being free to do what you want to do tomorrow."
* Principles of Shaping (chap 1)
  * Spectrum of projects: abstract <-> shaped <-> concrete
    * Wireframes are too concrete, and words are too abstract.
  * Property 1: it's rough
    * The advantage of a rough spec is that the team can see the open spaces where their contributions will
      go. Leave them room to apply their own expertise.
  * Property 2: it's solved
    * The overall solution is spelled out. The solution elements are connected.
  * Property 3: it's bounded
    * The idea's definition and scope matches the appetite the company has for it.
  * Shaping is strategic work. "Setting the appetite and coming up with a solution requires you to be critical
    about the problem. What are we trying to solve? Why does it matter? What counts as success? Which
    customers are affected? What is the cost of doing this instead of something else?"
  * Shaping is a closed-door, creative process.
  * There are two tracks here: one for shaping, one for building.
  * When shaping, flesh out the risks and the likely implementation rabbit holes
    * "Once we think we have a solution, we take a hard look at it to find holes or unanswered questions that
      could trip up the team. We amend the solution, cut things out of it, or specify details at certain
      tricky spots to prevent the team from getting stuck or wasting time."
* Set boundaries (chap 2)
  * The appetite: the time budget for this idea.
  * There's two appetite sizes:
    * Small batch: a project that can be built in 1-2 weeks by a team of one designer and 1-2 programmers. We
      batch a few of these together into a six week cycle.
    * Big batch: the project can be built in six weeks by the same size team.
  * Fixed time, variable scope
    * "An appetite is completely different from an estimate. Estimates start with a design and end with a
      number. Appetites start with a number and end with a design."
    * Set a time box and maximize what you can do within it.
    * (Isn't the use of "appetite" backwards for some types of work? If the descoped solution doesn't hit the
      business objectives, then its value may be zero, and thus so will be its appetite).
    * Also cap the shaping/research investment: "if it's not critical now and we can't get our hands around
      the problem, we'll walk away from it and work on something else."
* Find the elements (chap 3)
  * Leave room for the designers
    * "Regardless of what you say, any specific mockups are going to bias what other people do after you --
      especially if you're in a higher position than them. They'll take every detail in the initial mockups as
      direction even though you didn't intend it."
    * Fat-tipped markers elevate the level of abstraction, leaving room for the designer to make it concrete.
    * Provide the boundaries and rules for the game, not a spec.
* Risks and Rabbit Holes (chap 4)
  * The ideal delivery time distribution is tall and narrow, with its center at the appetite size (six weeks,
    in their case).
  * The distribution is long-tailed to the right if there's unidentified/unsolved rabbit holes when it goes to
    the implementation team.
  * In the shaping phase, pre-solve problems that wouldn't be fair for a designer or engineer to try and solve
    in the pressure of a cycle without introducing lots of delivery risk.
  * Declare out of bounds
    * "It's still a good idea to call out any cases you specifically aren't supporting to keep the project
      well within the appetite."
    * Builders will naturally try to cover every case, and make the solution excessively complete. Help them
      out.
  * "Instead of asking 'is it possible to do X?' ask 'is it possible to do x in 6 weeks?' That's a very
    different question."
  * Tactically, keep the clay wet by discussing at a whiteboard, not over a fleshed out doc or deck.
  * The pitch
    * "The pitch will be a document that we use to lobby for resources, collect wider feedback if necessary,
      or simply capture the idea for when the time is more ripe in the future."
    * The pitch then gets presented to the betting table.
* Write the pitch (chap 5)
  * A pitch has these components
    * Problem
    * Appetite: how much time we want to spend and how that constrains the solution
    * Solution
    * Rabbit holes: details to avoid
    * No-gos: anything specifically excluded from the concept.
  * A pitch needs a solution. "A problem without a solution is unshaped work. Giving it to a team means
    pushing research and exploration down to the wrong level, where the skillsets, time limit, and risk
    profile (thin vs. heavy tailed) are all misaligned."
  * Help the team see it: you need to provide enough visual detail to help sell the concept to the betting
    team.
  * Presenting a pitch
    * Review and comment on the pitch doc asynchronously. Then debate it live at the betting table.
* Bets, not backlogs (chap 6)
  * Backlogs
    * "Backlogs are a big weight we don't need to carry."
    * "The growing pile gives us a feeling like we're always behind even though we're not. Just because
      somebody thought some idea was important a quarter ago doesn't mean we need to keep looking at it again
      and again."
    * "Backlogs are time wasters. The time spent constantly reviewing, grooming and organizing old ideas
      prevents everyone from moving forward on the timely projects that really matter right now."
  * At six week boundaries, host a "betting table". Dispassionate review of where to place your chips.
    * "At the betting table, they look at pitches from the last six weeks -- or any pitches that somebody
      purposefully revived and lobbied for again. Nothing else is on the table."
      * Each option on the betting table is well-shaped and risk-reduced.
    * There is no organized view of the likely bets beyond 6 weeks.
      * "What if the pitch was great, but the time just wasn't right? Anyone who wants to advocate for it
        again simply tracks it independently -- their own way -- and then lobbies for it six weeks later."
  * Decentralized lists
    * The support team keeps a list of requests or issues that come up more often than others. Product
      managers track ideas they hope to be able to shape in a future cycle. Programmers maintain a list of
      bugs they'd like to fix when they have some time.
  * "This way the conversation is always fresh. Anything brought back is brought back with a context, by a
    person, with a purpose. Everything is relevant, timely, and of the moment."
  * Important ideas come back
    * Rare bugs will fade. Annoying bugs will keep getting encountered.
* The betting table (chap 7)
  * Six week cycles
    * Working in cycles simplifies the resources availability constraints. Everyone frees up at once.
    * "A cycle gives us a standard project size both for shaping and scheduling."
    * Says two week sprints are too little for shipping big things and there's too much planning overhead.
    * Cycles need to be short enough to see the end from the beginning, but long enough to allow for
      substantial momentum.
    * Cool down
      * They allocate two weeks after each cycle for cooldown. People can work on whatever they want. Bugs,
        POCs, mocks.
      * "After working hard to ship their six week projects, they enjoy having time that's under their
        control."
    * (I wonder if the cooldown period becomes the quality work overflow, where engineers go back and fix the
      corners that were cut? Is that a bad thing? It seems refreshing to have specific time to do this type of
      work earmarked. Maintains less debt, as a rule.)
  * Standardized team sizes
    * Each team is 1 designer and 1-2 engineers.
    * "Big batch" teams spend 6 weeks on a project.
    * "Small batch" teams use the cycle to do several 1-2 week projects.
  * 1-2 hour meeting. "Pitches" are available to review offline, beforehand.
  * A well set up betting table gives leadership a "hands on the wheel" feeling of control.
    * "The meeting is short, the options well-shaped, and the headcount low. When these criteria are met, the
      betting table becomes a place to exercise control over the direction of the product instead of a battle
      for resources or a plea for prioritization."
  * The meaning of a bet
    * It's a bet, not a plan.
    * The downside is capped to 6 weeks.
    * Bets have a payout, and thus ROI.
    * Bets are commitments of six weeks of focus.
      * Uninterrupted time: "It's not really a bet if we say we're dedicating six weeks but then allow a team
        to get pulled away to work on something else."
    * They only select bets for one cycle ahead, so they can react to big new needs with a max latency of six
      weeks.
  * Circuit breaker
    * There's an explicit policy that projects can fail if they exceed the appetite.
    * If a project runs over, it's paused, and gets put back on the shaping track for the following cycle.
      Assuming it gets reshaped, then in six weeks time, the newly reshaped, derisked version is available for
      consideration at the betting table.
    * "The circuit breaker motivates teams to take more ownership over their projects" and get them shipped.
  * Bugs: prioritize non-P0 bugs in the normal batch cycle schedule, and assign them to small-batch teams.
  * The advantage of considering big bugs at the level of the betting table:
    * "Time should always be used strategically. There's a huge difference between delaying other work to fix
      a bug versus deciding up front that the bug is worth the time to fix."
  * Break big projects into six week chunks. Shaping just one six week milestone at a time lowers the risk.
* Place your bets (chap 8)
  * Their expectations and approach to cycles differs based on whether it's an existing product or new
    product.
  * R&D mode
    * When in R&D mode, instead of an outcome, just commit time for a spike.
    * A senior team (the founders, in their case) do these R&D cycles. Once the project is derisked and
      transitions out of R&D into production, other teams come in.
    * "First, you can't delegate to other people when you don't know what you want yourself. Second, the
      architectural decisions will determine what's possible in the product's future -- they define the
      'holes' that future features fit into. At this phase the team needs to hold the vision of the product
      and be able to judge the long-term effects of design decisions."
    * Jason, David, and a senior designer spent a year exploring HEY.com and settling the core. Then another
      year to productionize it.
      * "The betting table didn't know they would be working on HEY for two years during those first few R&D
        cycles. Gradually they gained confidence in the idea and grew a big-picture appetite for how many
        cycles they were willing to spend on HEY."
  * Production mode
    * Developing an existing product.
    * When to exit from R&D mode and enter Production mode: "The product does those few essential things that
      define it, and the foundation is laid for the dozens of other things we'll have to do before we can
      ship to customers."
  * Cleanup mode
    * Reserving capacity before launch for the million things that are unexpected.
    * Consider making some cuts in the cleanup phase to reduce some of the post-launch support burden.
      * "A smaller surface area on a V1 means fewer questions to answer, less to support, and less we're
        committing to maintain indefinitely. Sometimes we need to see all the features working as a whole to
        judge what we can live without and what might require deeper consideration before shipping it to
        customers."
  * Questions to ask
    * Is the solution attractive?
      * The presence of complexity should reduce appetite.
    * Is this the right time?
      * Sometimes you need to introduce fresh new features, and sometimes you're in a season where you need to
        pay debt.
* Hand over responsibility (chap 9)
  * Let the team define their own approach. Risk-reducing via oversight might not be worth it.
  * Deploy and Q&A needs to be in cycle.
  * Docs and announcement are not done in the cycle.
    * "Those are thin-tailed from a risk perspective (they never take 5x as long as we think they will) an are
      mostly handled by other teams. We'll often take care of those updates and publish an announcement about
      the new feature during cool-down after a cycle."
  * Getting oriented: the first few days of a cycle are reviewing the current system and finding the best
    entry point. (Why don't they do this technical design before the cycle starts, to further derisk the
    cycle?)
  * Argues that you can't do sufficiently good task breakdowns until you start implementing. Then you discover
    all kinds of work.
* Get one piece done (chap 11)
  * Integrate vertically -- one "slice". E.g. do both the frontend and the backend, rather than just one.
  * Demo something early.
  * Start in the middle: hack on the interesting, meaty bit first. Derisk the most risky part.
* Map the scopes (chap 12)
  * Don't group tasks by person/role as the primary means of organization.
    * "People will complete tasks, but the tasks won't add up to a finished part of the project early enough."
  * "Scope map": breaking a project into scopes (complete features / vertically-integrated slices), and
    tackling each scope in sequence.
  * The set of scopes you pick becomes the language for the project: which things you group together as
    distinct features, the labels you use for those things. This language determines how the work is
    organized, and how progress is reported.
  * The recommended workflow is to generate many unscoped tasks, and then group them into scopes, and run at
    the first one.
  * Discovering scopes
    * This is mapping out "the anatomy of the problem."
    * "Scope mapping isn't planning. You need to walk the territory before you can draw the map."
    * "The scopes need to be discovered by doing the real work and seeing how things connect and don't
      connect."
      * You can't see the interdependencies during the planning phase. You see them after week one or two.
  * A poorly defined scope is one which has a name that is not unique to the project. E.g. "front-end work",
    "bugs". They're grab bags.
* Show progress (chap 13)
  * Work is shaped like a hill
    * The first, uphill phase is figuring out what to do. This phase progressively eliminates unknowns.
    * The second, downhill phase is execution: getting it done.
    * "The uphill phase is full of uncertainty, unknowns, and problem solving. The downhill phase is marked by
      certainty, confidence, seeing everything, and knowing what to do."
  * At Basecamp they project status by plotting each scope on a "hill diagram", to convey which part --
    eliminating uncertainty, or execution -- a scope is in. This is easy for the cycle team to do, and doesn't
    rely on fleshed out TODO lists or estimates.
  * Comparing hill charts over time to see which scopes the team is focusing on, and what's gotten stuck, is a
    powerful view.
  * Management should step in and troubleshoot or rework the project when a scope is getting stuck in the
    uphill portion.
  * Prioritize derisking, which means getting the hardest scopes to the top of the hill before doing the
    easier downhill portions.
* Decide when to stop (chap 14)
  * Summary thus far: "when the end of the cycle approaches, the techniques we covered so far will put the
    team in a good position to finish and ship. The shaped work gave them guard rails to prevent them from
    wandering. They integrated one scope at a time so there isn't half-finished work lying around. And all the
    most important problems have been solved because they prioritized those unknowns first when they sequenced
    the work."
  * When deciding whether it's good enough to ship, compare to the baseline
    * "Compare down to the baseline of what the product is today, not up to the ideal of what you intend to
      make it."
    * This helps overcome the desire to ship the perfect version of a new feature.
  * Six-week time box: "without a deadline, they could easily delay the project for changes that don't
    actually deserve the extra time."
  * Scope grows like grass; it's natural, and it's no one's fault.
  * Scope hammgering: "Chiseling scope down as the deadline approaches"
    * "People often talk abotu 'cutting' scope. We use an even stronger word -- hammering -- to reflect the
      power and force it takes to repeatedly bang the scope so it fits in the time box."
    * The act of marking unfinished tasks as nice-to-have is scope hammering. These tasks wait until the end
      of the cycle to get done, and only if there's time.
  * QA is for edge cases
    * Basecamp has millions of users, and a 12 person product team behind it. There's 1 QA person. The QA
      person's job is only to check edge cases. Developers take responsibility for the main cases.
    * "QA generates discovered tasks that are all nice-to-haves by default. The designer-programmer team
      triages them and, depending on severity and available time, eleveates some of them to must-haves."
* Move on (chap 15)
  * Feedback needs to be shaped
    * Don't immediately act on feedback from customers about a newly-launched feature.
