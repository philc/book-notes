* Intro
  * Six week cycles
    * "Six weeks is long enough to build something meaningful start-to-finish and short enough that everyone
      can feel the deadline looming from the start, so they use the time wisely."
  * Shaping the work
    * A small senior team works in parallel to the cycle team to shape and vet the next ste of bets.
      "Pre-work."
  * Targeting risk
    * The greatest risk is not shipping on time.
    * "This book is about the risk of getting stuck, the risk of getting bogged down with last quarter's work,
      wasting time on unexpected problems, and not being free to do what you want to do tomorrow."
* Principles of Shaping (chap 1)
  * Spectrum: abstract <-> shaped <-> concrete
    * Wireframes are too concrete, and words are too abstract.
  * Property 1: it's rough
    * The advantage of a rough spec is that they can see the open spaces where their contributions will go.
      Leave them room to apply their own expertise.
  * Property 2: it's solved
    * The overall solution is spelled out. The solution elements are connected.
  * Property 3: it's bounded
    * It's definition and scope matches the appetite the company has for it.
  * Shaping is strategic work. "Setting the appetite and coming up with a solution requires you to be critical
    about the problem. What are we trying to solve? Why does it matter? What counts as success? Which
    customers are affected? What is the cost of doing this instead of something else?"
  * Shaping is a closed-door, creative process.
  * There are two tracks: one for shaping, one for building.
  * When shaping, address risks and rabbit holes
    * "Once we think we have a solution, we take a hard look at it to find holes or unanswered questions that
      could trip up the team. We amend the solution, cut things out of it, or specify details at certain
      tricky spots to prevent the team from getting stuck or wasting time."
* Set boundaries (chap 2)
  * The appetite: the time budget for this idea.
  * There's two appetite sizes:
    * Small batch: a project team of one designer and 1-2 programmers can build in one or two weeks. We
      batch these together into a six week cycle.
    * Big batch: the project takes the same size team a full six weeks.
  * Fixed time, variable scope
    * "An appetite is completely different from an estimate. Estimates start with a design and end with a
      number. Appetites start with a number and end with a design."
    * Set a time box and maximize what you can do within it.
    * (Isn't the use of "appetite" backwards for some types of work? If the descoped solution doesn't hit the
      high note, then its value may be zero, and thus so will its appetite.)
    * Also cap the shaping/research investment: "if it's not critical now and we can't get our hands around
      the problem, we'll walk away from it and work on something else."
* Find the elements (chap 3)
  * Leave room for the designers
    * "Regardless of what you say, any specific mockups are going to bias what other people do after you --
      especially if you're in a higher position than them. They'll take every detail in the initial mockups as
      direction even though you didn't intend it.
    * Fat markers elevate the level of abstraction, leaving room for the designer.
    * Provide the boundaries and rules for the game, not a spec.
* Risks and Rabbit Holes (chap 4)
  * The ideal delivery time distribution is tall and narrow, with its center at the appetite size (six weeks
    in their case).
  * The distribution is long-tailed to the right when there's unidentified/unsolved rabbit holes when it
    goes to the implementation team.
  * In the shaping phase, pre-solve problems that wouldn't be fair for a designer to try and solve in the
    pressure of a cycle without introducing lots of delivery risk.
  * Declare out of bounds
    * "It's still a good idea to call out any cases you specifically aren't supporting to keep the project
      well within the appetite."
    * Builders will naturally try to cover every case, and make the solution excessively complete. Help them
      out.
  * "Instead of asking 'is it possible to do X?' ask 'is it possible to do x in 6 weeks?' That's a very
    different question."
  * Tactically, keep the clay wet by discussing at a whiteboard, not over a fleshed out doc or deck.
  * The pitch
    * "The pitch will be a document that we use to lobby for resources, collect wider feedback if necessary,
      or simply capture the idea for when the time is more ripe in the future."
    * The pitch then gets presented to the betting table.
* Write the pitch (chap 5)
  * A pitch has these components
    * Problem
    * Appetite: how much time we want to spend and how that constrains the solution
    * Solution
    * Rabbit holes: details to avoid
    * No-gos: anything specifically excluded from the concept.
  * A pitch needs a solution. "A problem without a solution is unshaped work. Giving it to a team means
    pushing research and exploration down to the wrong level, where the skillsets, time limit, and risk
    profile (thin vs. heavy tailed) are all misaligned."
  * Help them see it: you need to provide enough visual detail to help sell the concept to the betting team.
  * Presenting a pitch
    * Review and comment on the pitch doc asynchronously. Then debate it live at the betting table.
* Bets, not backlogs (chap 6)
