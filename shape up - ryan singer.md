* Intro
  * Six week cycles
    * "Six weeks is long enough to build something meaningful start-to-finish and short enough that everyone
      can feel the deadline looming from the start, so they use the time wisely."
  * Shaping the work
    * A small senior team works in parallel to the cycle team to shape and vet the next ste of bets.
      "Pre-work."
  * Targeting risk
    * The greatest risk is not shipping on time.
    * "This book is about the risk of getting stuck, the risk of getting bogged down with last quarter's work,
      wasting time on unexpected problems, and not being free to do what you want to do tomorrow."
* Principles of Shaping (chap 1)
  * Spectrum: abstract <-> shaped <-> concrete
    * Wireframes are too concrete, and words are too abstract.
  * Property 1: it's rough
    * The advantage of a rough spec is that they can see the open spaces where their contributions will go.
      Leave them room to apply their own expertise.
  * Property 2: it's solved
    * The overall solution is spelled out. THe solution elements are connected.
  * Property 3: it's bounded
    * It's definition and scope matches the appetite the company has for it.
  * Shaping is strategic work. "Setting the appetite and coming up with a solution requires you to be critical
    about the problem. What are we trying to solve? Why does it matter? What counts as success? Which
    customers are affected? What is the cost of doing this instead of something else?"
  * Shaping is a closed-door, creative process.
  * There are two tracks: one for shaping, one for building.
  * When shaping, address risks and rabbit holes
    * "Once we think we have a solution, we take a hard look at it to find holes or unanswered questions that
      could trip up the team. We amend the solution, cut things out of it, or specify details at certain
      tricky spots to prevent the team from getting stuck or wasting time."
* Set boundaries (chap 2)
  * The appetite: the time budget for this idea.
  * There's two appetitize sizes:
    * Small batch: a project team of one designer and 1-2 programmers can build in one or two weeks. We
      batch thes etogether into a six week cycle.
    * Big batch: the project takes the same size team a full six weeks.
  * Fixed time, variable scope
    * "An appetite is completely different from an estimate. Estimates start with a design and end with a
      number. Appetites start with a number and end with a design."
    * Set a time bo xand maximize what you can do within it.
    * (Isn't the use of "appetite" backwards for some types of work? If the descoped solution deson't hit the
      high note, then its value may be zero, and thus so will its appetite.)
    * Also cap the shaping/research investment: "if it's not critical now and we can't get our hands around the
      problem, we'll walk away from it and work on something else."
* Find the elements (chap 3)
