* Intro
  * Six week cycles
    * "Six weeks is long enough to build something meaningful start-to-finish and short enough that everyone
      can feel the deadline looming from the start, so they use the time wisely."
  * Shaping the work
    * A small senior team works in parallel to the cycle team to shape and vet the next ste of bets.
      "Pre-work."
  * Targeting risk
    * The greatest risk is not shipping on time.
    * "This book is about the risk of getting stuck, the risk of getting bogged down with last quarter's work,
      wasting time on unexpected problems, and not being free to do what you want to do tomorrow."
* Principles of Shaping (chap 1)
  * Spectrum: abstract <-> shaped <-> concrete
    * Wireframes are too concrete, and words are too abstract.
  * Property 1: it's rough
    * The advantage of a rough spec is that they can see the open spaces where their contributions will go.
      Leave them room to apply their own expertise.
  * Property 2: it's solved
    * The overall solution is spelled out. The solution elements are connected.
  * Property 3: it's bounded
    * It's definition and scope matches the appetite the company has for it.
  * Shaping is strategic work. "Setting the appetite and coming up with a solution requires you to be critical
    about the problem. What are we trying to solve? Why does it matter? What counts as success? Which
    customers are affected? What is the cost of doing this instead of something else?"
  * Shaping is a closed-door, creative process.
  * There are two tracks: one for shaping, one for building.
  * When shaping, address risks and rabbit holes
    * "Once we think we have a solution, we take a hard look at it to find holes or unanswered questions that
      could trip up the team. We amend the solution, cut things out of it, or specify details at certain
      tricky spots to prevent the team from getting stuck or wasting time."
* Set boundaries (chap 2)
  * The appetite: the time budget for this idea.
  * There's two appetite sizes:
    * Small batch: a project team of one designer and 1-2 programmers can build in one or two weeks. We
      batch these together into a six week cycle.
    * Big batch: the project takes the same size team a full six weeks.
  * Fixed time, variable scope
    * "An appetite is completely different from an estimate. Estimates start with a design and end with a
      number. Appetites start with a number and end with a design."
    * Set a time box and maximize what you can do within it.
    * (Isn't the use of "appetite" backwards for some types of work? If the descoped solution doesn't hit the
      high note, then its value may be zero, and thus so will its appetite.)
    * Also cap the shaping/research investment: "if it's not critical now and we can't get our hands around
      the problem, we'll walk away from it and work on something else."
* Find the elements (chap 3)
  * Leave room for the designers
    * "Regardless of what you say, any specific mockups are going to bias what other people do after you --
      especially if you're in a higher position than them. They'll take every detail in the initial mockups as
      direction even though you didn't intend it.
    * Fat markers elevate the level of abstraction, leaving room for the designer.
    * Provide the boundaries and rules for the game, not a spec.
* Risks and Rabbit Holes (chap 4)
  * The ideal delivery time distribution is tall and narrow, with its center at the appetite size (six weeks
    in their case).
  * The distribution is long-tailed to the right when there's unidentified/unsolved rabbit holes when it
    goes to the implementation team.
  * In the shaping phase, pre-solve problems that wouldn't be fair for a designer to try and solve in the
    pressure of a cycle without introducing lots of delivery risk.
  * Declare out of bounds
    * "It's still a good idea to call out any cases you specifically aren't supporting to keep the project
      well within the appetite."
    * Builders will naturally try to cover every case, and make the solution excessively complete. Help them
      out.
  * "Instead of asking 'is it possible to do X?' ask 'is it possible to do x in 6 weeks?' That's a very
    different question."
  * Tactically, keep the clay wet by discussing at a whiteboard, not over a fleshed out doc or deck.
  * The pitch
    * "The pitch will be a document that we use to lobby for resources, collect wider feedback if necessary,
      or simply capture the idea for when the time is more ripe in the future."
    * The pitch then gets presented to the betting table.
* Write the pitch (chap 5)
  * A pitch has these components
    * Problem
    * Appetite: how much time we want to spend and how that constrains the solution
    * Solution
    * Rabbit holes: details to avoid
    * No-gos: anything specifically excluded from the concept.
  * A pitch needs a solution. "A problem without a solution is unshaped work. Giving it to a team means
    pushing research and exploration down to the wrong level, where the skillsets, time limit, and risk
    profile (thin vs. heavy tailed) are all misaligned."
  * Help them see it: you need to provide enough visual detail to help sell the concept to the betting team.
  * Presenting a pitch
    * Review and comment on the pitch doc asynchronously. Then debate it live at the betting table.
* Bets, not backlogs (chap 6)
  * Backlogs
    * "Backlogs are a big weight we don't need to carry."
    * "The growing pile gives us a feeling like we're always behind even though we're not. Just because
      somebody thought some idea was important a quarter ago doesn't mean we need to keep looking at it again
      and again."
    * "Backlogs are time wasters. The time spent constantly reviewing, grooming and organizing old ideas
      prevents everyone from moving forward on the timely projects that really matter right now."
      * (It's not that expensive... or is it? Discussing old stories during sprint planning does seem to take
        awhile).
  * At six week boundaries, host a "betting table." Dispassionate review of where to place your chips.
    * "At the betting table, they look at pitches from the last six weeks -- or any pitches that somebody
      purposefully revived and lobbied for again. Nothing else is on the table."
      * Each option on the betting table is well-shaped and risk-reduced.
    * There is no organized view of the likely bets beyond 6 weeks.
      * "What if the pitch was great, but the time just wasn't right? Anyone who wants to advocate for it
        again simply tracks it independently -- their own way -- and then lobbies for it six weeks later."
  * Decentralized lists
    * Support an keep a list of requests or issues that come up more often than others. Product tracks ideas
      they hope to be able to shape in a future cycle. Programmers maintain a list of bugs they'd like to fix
      when they have some time.
  * "This way the conversation is always fresh. Anything brought back is brought back with a context, by a
    person, with a purpose. Everything is relevant, timely, and of the moment."
  * Important ideas come back
    * Rare bugs will fade. Annoying bugs will keep getting encountered.
* The betting table (chap 7)
  * Six week cycles
    * Working in cycles simplifies the resources availability constraints. Everyone frees up at once.
    * "A cycle gives us a standard project size both for shaping and scheduling."
    * Says two week sprints are too little for shipping big things and there's too much planning overhead.
    * Cycles need to be short enough to see the end from the beginning, but long enough to allow for
      substantial momentum.
    * Cool down
      * They allocate two weeks after each cycle for cooldown. People can work on whatever they want. Bugs,
        POCs, mocks.
      * "After working hard to ship their six week projects, they enjoy having time that's under their
        control."
    * (I wonder if the cooldown period becomes the quality work overflow, where the engineer goes back and
      fixes the corners that were cut? is that a bad thing? Seems refreshing to have that time to do so
      earmarked. Maintain less debt, as a rule.
  * Standardized team sizes
    * Each team is 1 designer and 1-2 engineers.
    * "Big batch" teams spend 6 weeks on a project.
    * "Small batch" teams use the cycle to do several 1-2 week projects.
  * 1-2 hour meeting. "Pitches" are available to review offline, beforehand.
  * A well set up betting table gives leadership a "hands on the wheel" feeling of control.
    * "The meeting is short, the options well-shaped, and the headcount low. )when these criteria are met, the
      betting table becomes a place to exercise control over the direction of the product instead of a battle
      for resources or a plea for prioritization."
  * The meaning of a bet
    * It's a bet, not a plan.
    * The downside is capped to 6 weeks.
    * Bets have a payout, and thus ROI.
    * Bets are commitments of six weeks of focus.
      * Uninterrupted time: "It's not really a bet if we say we're dedicating six weeks but then allow a team
        to get pulled away to work on something else."
    * They only select bets for one cycle ahead, so they can react to big new needs with a max latency of six
      weeks.
  * Circuit breaker
    * There's an explicit policy that projects can fail if they exceed the appetite.
    * If a project runs over, it's paused, and gets put back on the shaping track for the following cycle.
      Then it can surface again for betting on the reshaped, derisked version.
    * (This is good discipline).
    * "The circuit breaker motivates teams to take more ownership over their projects."
  * Bugs: prioritize non-P9 bugs in the normal batch cycle schedule, and assign them to small-batch teams.
  * The advantage of considering big bugs at the level of the betting table:
    * "Time should always be used strategically. )there's a huge difference between delaying other work to fix
      a bug versus deciding up front that the bug is worth the time to fix."
  * Break big projects into six week chunks. Shaping just one six week milestone at a time lowers the risk.
* Place your bets (chap 8)
  * Their expectations and approach to cycles differs based on whether it's an existing product or new
    product.
  * R&D mode
    * When in R&D mode, instead of an outcome, just commit time for a spike.
    * A senior team (the founders, in their case) do these R&D cycles. Once the project is derisked and
      transitions out of R&D into production, other teams come in.
    * "First, you can't delegate to other people when you don't know what you want yourself. Second, the
      architectural decisions will determine what's possible in the product's future -- they define the
      'holes' that future features fit into. At this phase the team needs to hold the vision of the product
      and be able to judge the long-term effects of design decisions."
    * Jason, David, and a senior designer spent a year exploring HEY and settling the core. Then another year
      to productionize it.
      * "The betting table didn't know they would be working on HEY for two years during those first few R&D
        cycles. Gradually they gained confidence in the idea and grew a big-picture appetite for how many
        cycles they were willing to spend on HEY."
  * Production mode
    * Developing an existing product.
    * When to exit from R&D mode and enter Production mode: "The product does those few essential things that
      define it, and the foundation is laid for the dozens of other things we'll have to do before we can
      ship to customers."
  * Cleanup mode
    * Reserving capacity before launch for the million things that are unexpected.
    * Considering making some cuts in the cleanup phase to reduce some of the post-launch support burden.
      * "A smaller surface area on a V1 means fewer questions to answer, less to support, and less we're
        committing to maintain indefinitely. Sometimes we need to see all the features working as a whole to
        judge what we can live without and what might require deeper consideration before shipping it to
        customers."
  * Questions to ask
    * Is the solution attractive?
      * The presence of complexity should reduce appetite.
    * Is this the right time?
      * Sometimes you need to introduce fresh new features, and sometimes you're in a season where you need to
        pay debt.
* Hand over responsibility (chap 9)
  * Let the team define their own approach. Risk-reducing via oversight might not be worth it.
  * Deploy and Q&A needs to be in cycle.
  * Docs and announcement are not done in the cycle.
    * "Those are thin-tailed from a risk perspective (they never take 5x as long as we think they will) an are
      mostly handled by other teams. We'll often take care of those updates and publish an announcement about
      the new feature during cool-down after a cycle."
  * Getting oriented: the first few days of a cycle are reviewing the current system and finding the best
    entrypoint. (Why don't they do this technical design before the cycle starts, to further derisk the
    cycle?)
  * Argues that you can't do sufficiently good task breakdowns until you start implementing. Then you discover
    all kinds of work.
* Get one piece done (chap 10)
  * TODO(philc):
