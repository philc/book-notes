I read this on Kindle June 2018.

* TODOs
  * Where is my weekend play book? I have one, I just need night activities and more variety and spice.

* Chapter 1 - the paradox of weekends
  * You have to commit to taking time off. Enjoy it deeply, do what’s fun. Host that BBQ.
  * But it's precious time. So have some structure. Your plan should answer the question "what would make me
    enjoy this time the most?". Then do it!
  * You have less than 1000 Saturdays with a child until they're grown up.
  * Weekends require even more care and planning than your work days, because they're so awesome and in such
    short supply.
  * Your weekend can be intense: a kind of labor or hobby. But it should be as different as possible from your
    work days. It's like cross training: put the stress on a different muscle group so you can maintain a high
    training intensity if desired.
  * The default activity should be to get outside and exercise. Blow off steam, get the blood flowing.
  * Planning a vacation in advance allows you to look forward to it. That's where most of the enjoyment comes
    from — not during the actual vacation. The vacation you imagine in your mind in the future is perfect;
    there are no annoyances, the weather is good; it's ideal.
  * So having anchor events in the calendar which are two months or more in the future unlocks this benefit.
  * The weekends have this same anticipation dynamic. So having a few anchor activities planned, like reading
    your book, a hike, dinner with friends, cooking a meal, or playing basketball allows you to relax and look
    forward to them. Planning o. Saturday morning feels painful, and there was no savoring and anticipation of
    the plan.
  * (I notice this effect when looking forward to playing b-ball on Friday afternoons, Monday evenings, or the
    Sunday game)

* Chapter 2: how to plan a weekend
  * Maintain a long bucket list of things you would want to do. Draw from this list when making a plan.
  * It's recommended to have a balanced ratio of activities, from exercise, social, and spiritual categories.
  * Weekend mornings are great for personal pursuits which are hard to do during the day when you’re taking
    care of kids. Get up early and workout or read or whatever.
  * (Maybe I should start getting up really early. I spend my nights on personal pursuits, but it's the end of
    the day rather than the start, so it's the remnants of my energy. Also, it's easier to go to sleep when
    the kids do, and it results in you being more relaxed when putting the kid to sleep).
  * Prep the day so you can get out the door and start that hike on time. This prep will make you feel more
    confident in how you're going about your weekend.
  * Make a ritual out of some recurring activities. E.g. a hike each Saturday morning, or dad cooks breakfast
    on Saturdays. They become routine and don't require any planning.
  * Schedule in nap time so everyone knows it’s coming. Kids can read or have screen time
  * Set your expectations for each activity so that you factor in exploration and adventure expansions. That
    way those things are savored when they happen, rather than feeling like disruptions.
  * End Sunday on a high note.
    * Schedule something, like an activity, a dinner with friends, or a movie night. On the other hand, some
      people use that time for planning the week ahead.
    * This is important, because even if you love your job, you get some anxiety about it on Sunday night.
      Work then encroaches on your weekend mind space.
    * Maybe a massage, so you can think and prepare for the week to come simultaneously.
  * Friday afternoons: use to plan for the weekend and to set your goals for the next work week
    * She recommends this time, because you're focused and it's a "low opportunity cost time"

* Chapter 3: minimize the have-to-dos
  * You have plenty of spare time in between anchor activities to do chores, but don't fill up your weekend
    that way. It causes stress. Plenty of gaps should be used for doing what you *want* to do, rather than
    what you have to.
  * Common stresses: chores, kids activities, and work that follows you home.
  * Groceries and laundry: batch them so they happen less often, and do them on a weeknight.
  * Create a time box for chores, so they don’t expand to fill all time. If you see something in the house
    that needs to be cleaned, you can mentally let it go, because you know it's scheduled for another time
  * A technology blackout for the sabbath has the benefit that all family members, especially kids, are forced
    to spend their time at home together.

* Chapter 4 - how to win the week ahead
  * Consider a Sunday night planning session for the week ahead. Do it, but time box it so you can do it
    reliably.
  * This is recommended by Covey.
  * It helps you chart out a few milestones you want to hit this week. You can pick just a handful and leave
    plenty of room for doing the unexpected. This gives you direction, and avoids you becoming too reactive
    with other people's priorities.
  * What you want to avoid is waking up Monday morning without a plan, and spending half the day putting one
    together as your attention is fragmented because of inbound requests.

* Chapter 5 - all there is
  * If you live until you're 80, you'll have 4100 weekends in your life.
  * If we crash into our weekends tired, the impulse to do nothing leads to a feeling that we're missing out
    on our own lives.
  * E.g. Christmas. Why not keep it simple, skip the cookie baking mess, and buying of gifts? Well... you only
    have 10 Christmas seasons where they're filled with excitement, so be careful not to opt out of many of
    these precious moments. Same with building a snowman -- how rare is it to have a snowy day while your kids
    are young enough to want to do it?
  * What are we saving our energy for? These weekends and our vacations are all there is. When you're sitting
    in your hospital bed, you'll be wishing for another snowy day and the opportunity to build that snowman
    with your child.
  * Labor day weekend can be melancholy: the kids are going back to school, summer is ending. Make use of
    this weekend! "Wring every last drop from summer." Go to Ocean City.
  * You have an experiencing self and a remembering self. The experiencing self gets exhausted from handling
    the kids on a road trip and is happy when it's done. But the remembering self converts those experiences
    into memories which fortify the soul in the quiet season of life that's to come.
    * Note to self: some trips are just less overhead. Like a road trip. A long flight with ground
      transportation on the other end, rental car, into a city is a lot of overhead and detracts from the trip
      itself.
  * Life cannot happen only in the future.
  * My takeaway: make each weekend count, and make them meaningful. When you're planning the weekend, ensure
    that it's a weekend worthy of being remembered.

* From her 168 hours TED talk
  * Every moment I spend is my choice. If I decide not to do something, it's not because I dont' have time,
    it's because it's not a priority.

  * Plan along these categories: career, relationships, self

* From her blog:
  * No one can actually make more time. Still, looking at my time logs reminds me that life is rich and full. My
    logs make these years that everyone says go so quickly feel more like an intricate tapestry than a slick
    linoleum floor. Time is precious, but time is also plentiful — feeling as vast as summer seems to a child
    ending the school year.
