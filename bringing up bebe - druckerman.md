    wait without frustration, and generally become comfortable delaying gratification.

* Intro
  * The American parenting problem: "One writer defines the problem as 'simply paying more attention to the
    upbringing of children than can possibly be good for them.'"
  * Argues that the overparenting wave came about due to: widening the rich-poor gap, which caused a more
    competitive parenting mindset; misled beliefs in the 80s onward that children are psychologically frail
    and need more of our attention; that kidnapper and abuser danger lurks everywhere.
  * "Yet the French have managed to be involved [in the lives of their children] without becoming obsessive.
    They assume that even good parents aren't at the constant service of their children."
* Paris is burping (chap 2)
  * Observes that French mothers are much calmer about pregnancy; they put on less weight, stress much less
    over the best practices and asking "is it safe?", and yet they have equally healthy birth stats.
* Doing her nights (chap 3)
  * Argues French parents have their kids sleeping through the night within a reasonable number of nights. Not
    using any fancy or branded sleep method. Basically, self-efficacy and being encourage to trust their
    bodies.
  * "The Pause": a common French parenting motion; pausing before attending to a baby's wants, to let them learn
    to self-soothe and deal with frustrations.
    * "The Pause works in part because parents believe that tiny babies aren't helpless blobs. They can learn
      things. This learning, done gently and at a baby's own pace, isn't damaging. To the contrary, parents
      believe it gives the babies confidence and serenity, and makes them aware of other people. And it sets
      the tone for the respectful relationship between parents and children that I see later on."
  * Even babies need some privacy. "The little baby learns in his cradle that he can be alone from time to
    time, without being hungry, without being thirsty, without sleeping, just being calmly awake. At a very
    young age, he needs time alone, and he needs to go to sleep and wake up without being immediately watched
    by his mother." - Dr. Leersynder
* Wait! (chap 4)
  * "Having kids who can wait makes family life more pleasant."
  * Making children eat at fixed meal times (and the same times as the adults eat) teaches them to wait, and
    wait without frustration, and generally become comfortable delaying gratification.
  * "When I tell Bean to be sage, I'm also telling her to behave appropriately. But I'm asking her to use good
    judgment and to be aware and respectful of other people. I'm implying that she has a certain wisdom about
    the situation and that she's in command of herself. And I'm suggesting that I trust her."
    * (I don't do this enough. Often, I lecture my daughter in public, to her shame, which she then resents.)
  * This is what French parents are "educating" their children about, fundamentally.
    * "I'm now convinced that the secret of why French kids rarely whine or collapse into tantrums -- or at
      least do so less than American kids -- is that they've developed the internal resources to cope with
      frustration. They don't expect to get what they want instantly."
  * "Kids learn how to distract themselves when they're made to wait. They just need to be given the chance."
  * Why do American parents bring snacks for their kids everywhere they go?
  * "In France the gouter is the official, and only, snack time. It's usually at about four thirty P.M., when
    kids get out of school. It has the same fixed status as other mealtimes and is universally observed for
    kids."
    * This preserves their hunger for the late dinner.
  * Eating meals together in an orderly fashion serves as "little capsules of patience training."
  * "Walter Mischel says the worst-case scenario for a kid from eighteen to twenty-four months of age is 'the
    child is busy and the child is happy, and the mother comes along with a fork full of spinach...'". The
    parent is not listening to the child's rhythms.
  * "French experts view learning to cope with 'no' as a crucial step in a child's evolution. It forces them
    to understand that there are other people in the world, with needs as powerful as their own."
  * "Making kids face up to limitations and eal with frustration turns them into happier, more resilient
    people."
* Tiny little humans (chap 5)
  * On parents who try to have their kids hit developmental milestones (like learn the alphabet; subtraction)
    sooner than their peers: "He didn't think that pushing kids to acquire skills ahead of schedule was either
    possible or desirable. He believed that children reach these milestones at their own speeds, driven by
    their own inner motors."
  * Cadre -- a strict frame, within which the kid has great liberty. The frame usually consists of rules and
    times for eating, sleeping, watching Tv.
  * Dolto popularized listening carefully to one's kids and giving them the credit of being rational, while
    still setting boundaries (a cadre).
