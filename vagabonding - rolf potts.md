* Vagabonding: a privately meaningful manner of travel that emphasizes creativity, adventure, awareness,
  simplicity, discovery, independence, realism, self-reliance, and the growth of the spirit.
* Earn your freedom (chap 2)
  * Vagabonding "is not for comfort hounds, sophomoric isanthropes or poolside faint-hearts, whose thing
  convictions won't stand up to the problems that come along" - Ed Buryn.
  * Having to work to earn your time and resources for travel make the trip much more rewarding and meaningful.
    Compare this mindset to "trustafarians."
  * Vagabonding isn't an escape from your real life, but a discovery of your real life.
  * Mindset: "make work serve your interests." Get your "recess" or take time off between jobs. Change jobs often
    if needed. Or get a formal sabbatical.
  * To stay safe, talk to locals and do business with mom-and-pop stores, rather than tourist spots.
* Keep it simple (chap 3)
  * If you simplify your life and reduce the amount of energy required to run it, it will unlock a "wealth of
    time".
  * "There is an overwhelming social compulsion -- an insanity of consensus -- to get rich from life rather
    than live richly, to 'do well' in the world instead of living well."
  * "Time becomes the only possession and everyone is equally rich in it by biological inheritance. Money, of
    course, is still needed to survive, but time is what you need to live. So, save what little money you
    possess to meet basic survival requirements, but spend your time lavishly in order to create the life
    values that make the fire worth the candle."
  * Debt will lock you down: "don't let avocado green furniture sets... dictate the course of your life by
    forcing you into ongoing cycles of production and consumption."
  * Vagabonding is, was, and always will be a private undertaking -- and its goal is to improve your life not
    in relation to your neighbors but in relation to yourself. Thus, if your neighbors consider your travels
    foolish, don't waste your time trying to convince them otherwise."
* Learn, and keep learning (chap 4)
  * Plan, but don't over-rely on your plan and the reported experiences of others.
  * "The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page" (attributed to Saint Augustine)
  * The savoring that comes from an upcoming trip:
    * "I prefer the hum of excitement that comes with carefully preparing at home for the trip to come."
  * "We find after years of struggle that we do not take a trip; a trip takes us."
  * "These authors write pictures and frame rhapsodies, and lesser men follow and see with the author's eyes
    instead of thei rown, and speak with his tongue..."
  * Guidebooks are so easy to procure on the ground, so take 1 with you and buy for other regions when you
    arrive there.
  * "The fanciful idea of learning to tango, for instance, might make you consider visiting Argentina." Or a
    setting from a favorite childhood movie, like Braveheart.
  * "The slow, nuanced experience of a single country is always better than the hurried, superficial
    experience of forty countries."
  * On travel buddies:
    * "Without a partner, I have complete independence, which inspires me to meet people and find experiences
      that I normally wouldn't have sought."
    * "Perfect harmony on the road is a pipe dream, so always allow your partnership room to breathe, even if
      this means amicably splitting up for weeks at a time."
  * "With such an attitude, most people find themsevles brimming with confidence after their first few days or
    vagabonding -- and kicking themselves for not having mustered the courage to do it years ago."
* Don't set limits (chap 5)
  * On the road, the mundane things in life become fun and exotic:
    * "once you take the plunge and get out on the road, you'll quickly find yourself giddy at how easy and
      thrilling it all is. Normal experiences (such as ordering food or taking a bus) will suddenly seem
      extraordinary and full of possibility. All the details of daily life that you ignored back home -- the
      taste of a soft drink, the sound of a radio, the smell of hte air -- will wuddenly seem rich and exotic.
      Food, fashions, and entertainment will prove delightfully quirky and shockingly cheap. In spite of all
      your preparation, you will invariably find yourself wanting to know more about the histories and
      cultures that envelop you. The subtle buzz of the unknown, initially a bit of a fright, will soon prove
      adictive: simple trips to the market or the toilet can turn into adventures: simple conversations can
      lead to charming friendships."
  * Awesome density of experience:
    * "Travel in general, and vagabonding in particular, produces an awesome density of experience. A cramming
      together of incidents, impressions and life detail that is both stimulating and exhausting. So much new
      and different happens to you so frequently, just when you're most sensitive to it... you may be excited,
      bored, confused, despearate and amazed all in the same happy day."
  * "Slow down... take things as they come. Don't hit all the sights straight away."
  * "In many ways, this transition into travel can be compared to childhood: everything you see is new and
    emotionally affecting, basic tasks like eating and sleeping take on a heightened significant, and
    entertainment can b efound in the simplest curiosities and novelties."
  * You'll make mistakes, forget things, get swindled. But that'st part of the experience and learning curve.
  * Walk off of the well-paved road of tourst attractions if the populatiry of the sights annoys you. Most
    don't, for some reason.
  * "If you set off on down the road with specific agendas and goals, you will at best discover the pleasure
    of actualizing them. But if you wander with open eyes and simple curiosity, you'll discover a much richer
    pleasure -- the simple feeling of *possibility* that hums from every direction as you move from place to
    place."
  * On haggling:
    * Let the merchant make the first offer -- and don't respond by offering half the price and haggling from
      there. The merchants already expect you to do this, and they adjust their prices accordingly. Instead,
      see if the merchant will make another, lower offer before you start making bids.
