* Vagabonding: a privately meaningful manner of travel that emphasizes creativity, adventure, awareness,
  simplicity, discovery, independence, realism, self-reliance, and the growth of the spirit.
* Earn your freedom (chap 2)
  * Vagabonding "is not for comfort hounds, sophomoric misanthropes or poolside faint-hearts, whose thing
  convictions won't stand up to the problems that come along" - Ed Buryn.
  * Having to work to earn your time and resources for travel make the trip much more rewarding and
    meaningful. Compare this mindset to "trustafarians."
  * Vagabonding isn't an escape from your real life, but a discovery of your real life.
  * Mindset: "make work serve your interests." Get your "recess" or take time off between jobs. Change jobs
    often if needed. Or get a formal sabbatical.
  * To stay safe, talk to locals and do business with mom-and-pop stores, rather than tourist spots.
* Keep it simple (chap 3)
  * If you simplify your life and reduce the amount of energy required to run it, it will unlock a "wealth of
    time".
  * "There is an overwhelming social compulsion -- an insanity of consensus -- to get rich from life rather
    than live richly, to 'do well' in the world instead of living well."
  * "Time becomes the only possession and everyone is equally rich in it by biological inheritance. Money, of
    course, is still needed to survive, but time is what you need to live. So, save what little money you
    possess to meet basic survival requirements, but spend your time lavishly in order to create the life
    values that make the fire worth the candle."
  * Debt will lock you down: "don't let avocado green furniture sets... dictate the course of your life by
    forcing you into ongoing cycles of production and consumption."
  * Vagabonding is, was, and always will be a private undertaking -- and its goal is to improve your life not
    in relation to your neighbors but in relation to yourself. Thus, if your neighbors consider your travels
    foolish, don't waste your time trying to convince them otherwise."
* Learn, and keep learning (chap 4)
  * Plan, but don't over-rely on your plan and the reported experiences of others.
  * "The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page" (attributed to Saint Augustine)
  * The savoring that comes from an upcoming trip:
    * "I prefer the hum of excitement that comes with carefully preparing at home for the trip to come."
  * "We find after years of struggle that we do not take a trip; a trip takes us."
  * "These authors write pictures and frame rhapsodies, and lesser men follow and see with the author's eyes
    instead of thei rown, and speak with his tongue..."
  * Guidebooks are so easy to procure on the ground, so take 1 with you and buy for other regions when you
    arrive there.
  * "The fanciful idea of learning to tango, for instance, might make you consider visiting Argentina." Or a
    setting from a favorite childhood movie, like Braveheart.
  * "The slow, nuanced experience of a single country is always better than the hurried, superficial
    experience of forty countries."
  * On travel buddies:
    * "Without a partner, I have complete independence, which inspires me to meet people and find experiences
      that I normally wouldn't have sought."
    * "Perfect harmony on the road is a pipe dream, so always allow your partnership room to breathe, even if
      this means amicably splitting up for weeks at a time."
  * "With such an attitude, most people find themsevles brimming with confidence after their first few days or
    vagabonding -- and kicking themselves for not having mustered the courage to do it years ago."
* Don't set limits (chap 5)
  * On the road, the mundane things in life become fun and exotic:
    * "once you take the plunge and get out on the road, you'll quickly find yourself giddy at how easy and
      thrilling it all is. Normal experiences (such as ordering food or taking a bus) will suddenly seem
      extraordinary and full of possibility. All the details of daily life that you ignored back home -- the
      taste of a soft drink, the sound of a radio, the smell of hte air -- will wuddenly seem rich and exotic.
      Food, fashions, and entertainment will prove delightfully quirky and shockingly cheap. In spite of all
      your preparation, you will invariably find yourself wanting to know more about the histories and
      cultures that envelop you. The subtle buzz of the unknown, initially a bit of a fright, will soon prove
      adictive: simple trips to the market or the toilet can turn into adventures: simple conversations can
      lead to charming friendships."
  * Awesome density of experience:
    * "Travel in general, and vagabonding in particular, produces an awesome density of experience. A cramming
      together of incidents, impressions and life detail that is both stimulating and exhausting. So much new
      and different happens to you so frequently, just when you're most sensitive to it... you may be excited,
      bored, confused, despearate and amazed all in the same happy day."
  * "Slow down... take things as they come. Don't hit all the sights straight away."
  * "In many ways, this transition into travel can be compared to childhood: everything you see is new and
    emotionally affecting, basic tasks like eating and sleeping take on a heightened significant, and
    entertainment can b efound in the simplest curiosities and novelties."
  * You'll make mistakes, forget things, get swindled. But that'st part of the experience and learning curve.
  * Walk off of the well-paved road of tourst attractions if the populatiry of the sights annoys you. Most
    don't, for some reason.
  * "If you set off on down the road with specific agendas and goals, you will at best discover the pleasure
    of actualizing them. But if you wander with open eyes and simple curiosity, you'll discover a much richer
    pleasure -- the simple feeling of *possibility* that hums from every direction as you move from place to
    place."
  * On haggling:
    * Let the merchant make the first offer -- and don't respond by offering half the price and haggling from
      there. The merchants already expect you to do this, and they adjust their prices accordingly. Instead,
      see if the merchant will make another, lower offer before you start making bids.
* Meet your neighbors (chap 6)
  * The experience off vagabonding revolves around the people you meet on the road.
    * "If you view the world as a predominately hostile place, it will be" wrote Ed Buryn. By this same logic,
      a positive worldview can lead to inspiring, human-centered road experiences.
  * Don't congregate just with people you like: fellow travelers, while easy and rewarding, will be probably
    less iconic and memorable.
    * "Which encounter, after all, will teach you the most in Punjab: drinking Kingfisher lager with friendly
      agnostic New Zealanders or sipping tea with friendly Indian Sikhs? Which activity would you enjoy most
      in Cuba: scuba diving with a gregarious German college student or rumba dancing with a gregarious Havana
      grandmother? Which of these experiences woudol you most likely share with your friends when you got
      home? Which would you remember best in your old age?"
  * "People travel to faraway places to watch, in fascination, the kind of people they ignore at home" -
    Dogabert Runes. (e.g. the ethnic practices of a culture, like mexicans, whom they also have as neighbors
    and could just observe at home).
  * Many of your relationships with locals will be a front for them to sell you something, but that's not a
    bad thing if you understand the dynamic. Their tourism industry arose out of genuine hospitality.
    * "Of all the locals I hung out with in Egypt, my truest Eyption friend was a hotel clerk who accompanied
      me to movies and markets during his time off from work. Of all the people I met in Burma, I learned the
      most about the local culture from a trishaw driver who (after pedaling me around on a paid tour of the
      Sagaing area) took me home to meet his family and insisted I sleep for free at the neighborhood
      monastery."
  * "Be aware that you occupy an economic dynamic whereever you go -- and that there is no particular virtue
    in compulsively avoiding expenses (especially when many of those expenses are of direct benefit to local
    families)."
  * "Even if you do get 'ripped off' as an outsider, remember that event his is part of a time-honored
    tradition."
* Get into adventures (chap 7)
  * Adventure is not about extreme feats or exploring frontiers. The frontiers have all been settled.
    * "Which is the real addventure: spending three grand on a mach-one MiG jet ride over Kamchatka or
      spending the same sum exploring the cities and villages of Siberia by train and motorcycle?"
  * Adventure is a way of interpreting your recent travels.
  * "The secret of adventure is not to carefully seek it out, but to travel in such a way that it finds you.
    To do this, you need to overcome the protective habits of home and open yourself up to unpredictability.
* Be creative (chap 9)
  * Your travel goals and preferences will quickly evolve after you've been traveling through your dream spots
    for a few weeks.
    * "you'll gradually come ot understand why longtime travelers insist that the journey itself is far more
      important than any destination."
  * If you find yourself settling into a consistent routine, and the places are blurring together, mix it up.
    Visit the city or countryside or vice versa. Alone? Find a companion. Innovate on your transportation;
    take an interesting method of transport to get from one side of the region to the other.
  * "Should you have hobbies -- cooking, painting, music, meditation -- you might take this time to deepen and
    diversify such interests within an exotic new context." Pickup games of chess, or basketball
  * Volunteer work, to inject some meaning into your travels. E.g. working with kids at an afterschool program
    in Peru.
