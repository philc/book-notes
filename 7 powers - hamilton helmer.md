* Intro
  * A strategy framework "prepares the mind" so that you can correctly make the crux decisions. It
    should be simple but not simplistic.
  * Statics: "being there." What makes Intel's microprocessor business so durably valuable?
  * Dynamics: "getting there." What developments yielded this attractive state of affairs at Intel
    in the first place?
  * Power: the set of conditions creating the potential for persistent differential returns
    * "We can only assume microprocessors possessed some sort of rare characteristics which
      materially improved cash flow, while simultaneously inhibiting competitive arbitrage."
  * strategy: A route to continuing Power in significant markets.
  * Potential value = market scale * Power
  * Being a clever business person is not sufficient to achieve differential long-term value
    creation.
  * Power delivers to the firm both a Benefit and a Barrier
    * For the differential returns to be durable, there must be some barrier preventing the
      competition from performing arbitrage.
  * "In Intel's case, the heart of its microprocessors strategy can be best understood not by
    sorting through the multiplicity of Intel's value improvements, but by deducing why decades of
    capable and committed competition failed to emulate or undermine those improvements."
  * Single business focus: each business within a company will have its own strategy landscape.
* Scale economies (chap 1)
  * Netflix, on transitioning from mail DVDs to streaming:
    * "Given the uncertainty inherent in this emerging field, they took their time, demurring on
      high-testosterone bet-the-company antics."
  * "But deploying smart tactics, though complex and demanding, is not itself a strategy, and indeed
    any potential for Power remained opaque in those early days. For the time, Netflix could only
    stay alert and hope that Pasteur's dictum (["Chance Favors the Prepared Mind"]) would eventually
    bear fruit and chance would favor their prepared minds."
  * Netflix was able to afford original content because the cost to produce it was amortized across
    their large subscriber base. Less scaled competitors couldn't justify the investment on original
    content.
    * "In the Netflix example we see a feature of Scale Economies that recurs in many technology
      firms: a single fixed cost which declines per unit as it is prorated over higher and higher
      volumes."
    * (Couldn't this be argued to be the case for all complex software, since it has zero marginal
      cost to service new users?)
  * Benefit: reduced cost
  * Barrier: prohibitive costs of share gains
  * To gain scale, an entrant must offer lower prices or better quality. A market leader will
    observe that, and price-match to prevent the erosion of their scale economies.
  * Other types of scale economies
    * Distribution network density
    * Learning economies: if learning leads to a product benefit, and it's positively correlated
      with production levels, then a scale advantage accrues to the leader.
      * (Liftoff had this data advantage against smaller DSPs, although the data advantage has
        diminishing returns with scale.)
      * Google Search has this.
    * Purchasing economies: when a large buyer can command lower prices, e.g. Wal-Mart.
* Network Economies (chap 2)
  * Examples: MS Windows, Facebook, LinkedIn
  * "Network Economies occur when the value of a product to a customer is increased by the use of
    the product by others."
  * Benefit: product is more valuable with each incremental user
  * Cost: value deficit of a follower can be prohibitive.
  * Common characteristics of Network Economies:
    * Winner takes all
    * Boundedness: "as powerful as this Barrier is, it is bounded by the character of the network,
      something well-demonstrated by the continued success of both Facebook and LinkedIn. Facebook
      has powerful Network Economies itself but these have to do with personal and not professional
      interactions. The boundaries of the network effects determine the boundaries of the business."
  * Indirect network effects (AKA demand side network effects)
    * "If a business has important complements and these complements are somehow exclusive to each
      offering, then a leader will attract more and/or better complements.
    * Examples: a mobile OS having a good app ecosystem, which a new entrant cannot replicate.
* Counter positioning (chap 3)
  * Basically, the innovator's dilemma.
  * Benefit: new business model is superior to the incumbent's model due to lower costs or the
    ability to charge higher prices.
  * Barrier: by adopting the new model, the incumbent will incur collateral damage because they
    would have to give up an existing lucrative position.
  * Incumbents are not stupid. They are often constrained from adopting the challenger's strategy.
    * "The incumbent's failure to respond, more often than not, results from thoughtful calculation.
      They observe the upstart's new model and ask, 'Am I better off staying the course, or adopting
      the new model?' Counter-Positioning applies to the subset of cases in which the expected
      damage to the existing business elicits a 'no' answer from the incumbent. The Barrier, simply
      put, is collateral damage. In the Vanguard case, Fidelity looked at their highly attractive
      active management franchise and concluded that the new passive funds' more modest returns
      would likely fail to offset the damage done by a migration from their flagship products."
  * Note that some tech revolutions just change the landscape, and the incumbent has no ability to
    compete and obtain power in the new landscape. This is not a case of Counter-Positioning.
    * Example: Kodak and digital cameras. They were a film company had no competency in digital.
  * Why don't incumbents suffer the collateral damage?
    * In retrospect, it may have made sense for the incumbent to suffer the collateral damage and
      adopt the new approach, but new strategies are often high uncertainty, and so it's not
      reasonable for the incumbent to act -- action has a lower expected value than inaction.
    * There's also an agency problem: it's hard to align a CEO's compensation to allow for pivots.
      * "Addressing the threat of a Counter-Positioned competitor frequently requires upending the
        incumbent's business in multiple ways, and such turmoil is rarely symmetric in its impact on
        enterprise value and compensation, even with best practice Long-Term Incentive Plans in
        place."
  * Counter-Positioning creates power against a larger incumbent, but creates no power against
    competitors similar to the entrant. E.g. in-and-out vs. Five Guys. Both of them are
    counter-positioned against McDonald's, but they need different power to compete with each other.
  * Five Stages of Counter-Positioning (how new incumbents react to counter-positioning): denial,
    ridicule, fear, anger, capitulation.
    * Capitulation happens often too late, via "dabbling," because there's dual pressures to adopt
      the new model but also preserve the existing business.
  * "The only bet worthwhile for a challenger is one in which *even if the incumbent plays its best
    game*, it can be taken off the board. A competent Counter-Positioned challenger must take
    advantage of the strengths of the incumbent, as it is this strength which molds the Barrier,
    collateral damage."
* Switching costs (chap 4)
  * It's hard for a business to switch from S&P's ERP software, or MS Office, or for consumers to
    switch away from iTunes.
  * "A company like SAP, profiting from the indenture of its clients, has all incentive to hike the
    prices of such services."
  * "Switching Costs arise when a consumer values compatibility across multiple purchases from a
    specific firm over time."
    * Or, if the customer had to customize the deployment of the solution.
  * Benefit: firm can charge higher prices.
  * Barrier: to offer an equivalent product, competitors must compensate customers for Switching
    Costs. This makes share grains for the entrant expensive and thus less attractive.
  * Note that Switching Costs do not offer power over new, potential customers. Entrants can compete
    for those new customers without suffering from the barrier.
  * Types of switching costs
    * Financial: customer has to restart their investment and perform a migration.
    * Procedural: retraining, unfamiliarity with the new solution, new headcount, risk resulting
      from the migration.
    * Relational: it's hard to abandon a community that the user likes and identifies with.
  * The firm can increase related sales to existing, captured customers, by introducing new product
    lines, potentially by M&A.
  * The more product lines that get adopted increases customer entanglement and thus switching
    costs.
  * Switching Costs power can lead to Branding power
    * "If the product preference of users already tethered by Switching Costs spills over to a wider
      pool of potential customers, you could find yourself enjoying the effects of Branding."
* Branding (chap 5)
  * "Branding is an asset that communicates information and evokes positive emotions in the
    customer, leading to an increased willingness to pay for the product."
  * The brand is built on historical information that buyers accumulate about the seller.
  * Benefit: the firm is able to charge higher prices due to affective valence or uncertainty
    reduction.
    * Affective valence: built-up associations with the brand which elicit good feelings which are
      distinct from the actual underlying value of the good.
    * Uncertainty reduction: the customer expects less risk in their usage experience, because of
      the product's brand.
  * Barrier: "a strong brand can only be created over a lengthy period of reinforcing actions
    (hysteresis), which itself serves as the key Barrier. Again, Tiffany has cultivated its brand
    name for more than a century. What's more, copycats face daunting uncertainty in initiating
    Branding: a long investment runway with no assurance of an eventual path to significant
    affective valence."
  * Brand dilution: taking actions which contradict historical actions. E.g. a luxury brand
    introducing a "value" line of products.
  * Only certain types of goods have Branding potential:
    * For a brand to have branding power, the type of good being purchased must be bought based on
      affective valence.
    * "Business-to-business goods typically fail to exhibit meaningful affective valence price
      premia, since most purchasers are only concerned with objective deliverables. Consumer goods,
      in particular those associated with a sense of identity, tend to have the purchasing decision
      more driven by affective valence. Here's the reason: in order to associate with an identity,
      there must be some way to signal the exclusion of alternative identities."
    * Uncertainty reduction is valuable in products where failure is highly undesirable.
      * "Such products tend to be those associated with bad tail events: safety, medicine, food,
        transport, etc."
* Cornered resource (chap 6)
  * Cornered resource: celebrity talent, patent or key invention, property rights on a key resource,
    secret or non-replicable R&D process.
  * Pixar had celebrity talent: the only team that could produce animated films at that quality.
    They didn't defect, because they were making history.
    * (The use the Pixar brain trust as an example of an exclusive, cornered resource. This sounds
      like what we had with the early Liftoff team. The team was potent and non-replicable, and
      differentiated talent within the ad tech space, given ad tech had a dearth of strong talent
      outside of Big Tech).
  * Benefit: the resource produces an uncommonly appealing product.
  * Barrier: fiat -- the resource is cornered via decree, either general or personal ("personal"
    meaning that the celebrity talent has chosen to exclusively work with the firm for some reason).
  * If the firm secures exclusive access to a coveted resource but has to pay such that all of the
    value is arbitraged out, then it is not power. Example: a production studio signing an expensive
    big-name actor.
* Process power (chap 7)
  * Benefit: the firm is able to improve the product, or lower costs, as the result of process
    improvements embedded in the firm. E.g. Toyota with TPS (Toyota Production System).
  * Barrier: hysteresis: the process advances are difficult to replicate and can only be achieved
    over a long time period of sustained evolutionary advance.
  * The inherent "speed limit" in replicating a firm's process advancements is due to complexity and
    opacity. Opacity meaning the process is not fully codified and thus not easily portable -- it's
    difficult to tease out what parts and dependencies are making it so successful.
  * This power is rare.
    * "The type of Benefit it cites -- evolutionary bottom-up improvement -- stands at the heart of
      operational excellence; as such, it is quite common. The rarity of Process Power results from
      the infrequency of the Barrier: an unyielding, long-time constant for the improvements in
      question."
    * Operational excellence is not a strategy. It doesn't confer sustainable differentiation over
      competent competitors.
  * Argues the quality / cost reduction gains over time -- "traveling along the experience curve" --
    are widely similar across firms.
  * Operational excellence is essential for establishing sources of power, but it is not itself
    power.
* The path to power - "me too" won't do (chap 8)
  * (Helpful chapter on how firms actually transition from having no Power to having Power).
  * "Armed with one or more of these Power types, your business is ideally positioned to become a
    durable cash-generator, despite the best efforts of competitors. If you possess none of these,
    your business is at risk."
  * "Competitors can easily mimic the improvements yielded by operational excellence, eventually
    arbitraging out the value to the business."
  * Netflix had counter-positioning power against Blockbuster when it was in the DVD business. But
    it had no power in the streaming business, despite being a first mover, and competent.
    "Operational excellence is not a strategy."
  * "here one might hypothesize some Scale Economies: as Netflix accumulates more data, the acuity
    of their recommendations increases. True, but not linear: these advantages paid only diminishing
    returns, meaning a smaller competitor of an attainable scale could realize most of the same
    benefit."
    * Sounds like a criticism that could be made against any personalization company claiming their
      data sets provide durable Power.
  * Netflix spent most of their time on operational excellence, and rightfully so -- it was
    necessary, but not sufficient, to guarantee ongoing differentiation.
  * Transitioning into originals unlocked Economies of Scale power, because the content became a
    fixed rather than variable cost, and could be consumed by Netflix's existing large subscriber
    base -- larger than competitors'.
  * "The saga of Netflix's ascent exemplifies intelligent adaptation over an extended period in the
    face of daunting uncertainty. The terrain of entrepreneurs, not planners."
  * "Prior to Netflix's success, the value potential was opaque to the investment community, not
    because investors were thoughtless or ill-informed, but because the 'route to Power' was not
    just unknown, but unknowable -- even to Netflix management."
    * As soon as they established power and proved it, their share price increased 100x.
  * What route did Netflix take to creating Power? They took the competitive position of an
    attractive new service. "Netflix's pioneering rollout excited customers, and their influx
    propelled Netflix to an early relative scale advantage that the company has never relinquished."
  * The 7 powers maps "the only seven worthwhile destinations" for a company.
  * "Crafting": the author argues that Netflix crafted their course through experimentation and
    testing the waters, rather than far-sighted strategic planning.
    * Crafting was the only feasible way to discover and develop all of the complements to their
      streaming product.
  * The first cause of every power type is invention: some new thing to break in with.
  * "Flux" creates new footholds for invention to crack open the market and for firms to obtain
    power.
  * "The 7 Powers framework focuses your attention on the critical issues and increases the odds of
    a favorable outcome." This is "the most that strategy can accomplish, as the company develops
    inventions."
  * (If power only follows invention, then a firm without power should dedicate itself to having a
    malleable development process and seek positions of high potential energy, to fuel the rate of
    invention.)
  * Value capture: "Invention drives a favorable change in system economics -- you get more for
    less. The resulting gain in the end will be split somehow between your company and other
    segments of the value chain. The 7 Powers is all about making sure that you get some of the
    increase. But it is the gain customers experience that will shape the market size."
  * "Compelling value", that is sufficiently compelling such that customers rapidly adopt a product,
    differs in magnitude by industry. For software, compelling may mean a 10x improvement. For
    battery efficiency, it might be 2x. Jobs described this threshold as "insanely great" products.
  * How to create invention and compelling value? Several options:
    * Start from:
    * 1) Your capabilities: customer need is unknown; takes awhile. E.g. Pixar.
    * 2) Customer needs: well-known customer problem. Risk is technical: can you solve the problem?
    * 3) Competitor-led: With a new technique or chaning environment, can you offer 10x better
      solution and then stay ahead?
* The power progression (chap 9)
  * Intel as a case study: they had operational excellence and world class management in both their
    memory and microprocessor business, but only one provided an enduring high-margin business,
    because in microprocessors Intel had Power.
  * MS-DOS and Lotus 123 were written for the Intel processor. This meant that IBM PC clones had to
    adopt Intel chips too. This network economy eventually disappeared as OSes and applications
    abstracted away the chipset.
  * "The one-sentence story of Intel is a single design win, then a decade and a half of very high
    Switching Costs, then Scale Economies."
  * (This chapter has a helpful, thorough analysis of each of Intel's sources of power)
  * All of Intel's sources of Power (scale economies, network economies, switching costs) were
    rooted in their takeoff period.
  * Network economies: the takeoff stage is critical for this power, because Network Economies are
    often characterized by a tipping point: "once the leader has achieved an edge in installed base,
    most users will find it to their benefit to choose that leader."
    * (This was the case with Microsoft's languages, and later their operating systems. "We set the
      standard.")
  * "Takeoff is the stage when differential customer acquisition can take place at favorable terms,
    which is why it presents such ideal Power opportunities."
    * From the author's experience, the "takeoff period" for companies in a market lasts while the
      business is growing 40% or more per year. Such high growth indicates ongoing flux and
      opportunity to establish power, and for market leadership swaps.
  * "If a company has not established Power, competitive arbitrage will catch up as soon as growth
    slows; fundamentals will assert themselves, and the favorable early returns will prove
    fleeting."
    * The company will transition to being a low-margin player running hard on a treadmill of
      competition.
    * (Thiel: competition is for losers)
  * "The [Benefit of power] are common, and they often bear little positive impact on company value,
    as they are generally subject to full arbitrage. The true potential for value lies in those rare
    instances in which you can *prevent* such arbitrage, and it is the Barrier which accomplishes
    this. Thus, the decisive attainment of Power often syncs up with the establishment of the
    Barrier."
  * So, the question is, "when must Power be established"? It varies by the type of Power.
  * Power progression: Phase of business -> when a power can be established
    * Origination: Cornered Resource, Counter-Positioning
    * Takeoff: Network Economies, Scale Economies, Switching Costs
    * Stability: Branding, Process Power
  * "The Counter-Positioning and Cornered Resource are most likely to be established in the
    origination stage. These are wonderful, durable types of Power specifically because your 'route
    to Power' is locked in early, so lon gas you execute well."
  * Process Power is developed in the stability phase. "Only when a company has scaled sufficiently
    and operated long enough can it have evolved processes which are sufficiently complex or opaque
    to defy speedy emulation."
  * Branding: if one can invest enough time into branding, and remaining a market leader until the
    stability phase, then you can qualify for this power, which is unavailable to new entrants.
  * "In the high flux shortened time frame of the takeoff Stage, sufficiently timely imitation
    becomes less likely, and excellent execution can be highly strategic."
  * (Warren Buffet) "Good managers can rarely reverse the course of a bad business, i.e. one without
    Power."
  * A business must have a route to Power over each one of its competitors for it to have
    sustainable differentiation. The Power used may be different per competitor.
  * The prospect of monopoly profits is the incentive -- the fuel -- for invention.
    * "From a static viewpoint, the search for POwer may seem like a zero sum game of preventing
      gains flowing to consumers. But from a Dynamics viewpoint, it is the possibility of Power that
      is a critical motivator of invention."
