* Intro
  * A strategy framework "prepares the mind" so that you can correctly make the crux decisions. It should be
    simple but not simplistic.
  * Statics: "being there." What makes Intel's microprocessor business so durably valuable?
  * Dynamics: "getting there." What developments yielded this attractive state of affairs in the first place?
  * Power: the set of conditions creating the potential for persistent differential returns
    * "We can only assume microprocessors possessed some sort of rare characteristics which materially
      improved cash flow, while simultaneously inhibiting competitive arbitrage."
  * strategy: A route to continuing Power in significant markets.
  * Potential value = market scale * Power
  * Being a clever business person is not sufficient to achieve long-term differentiated value creation.
  * Power delivers to the firm both a Benefit and a Barrier
    * For the differentiated returns to be durable, there must be some barrier preventing the competition from
      performing arbitrage.
  * "In Intel's case, the heart of its microprocessors strategy can be best understood not by sorting through
    the multiplicity of Intel's value improvements, but by deducing why decades of capable and committed
    competition failed to emulate or undermine those improvements."
  * Single business focus: each business within a company will have its own strategy landscape.
* Scale economies (chap 1)
  * Netflix, on transitioning from mail DVDs to streaming:
    * "Given the uncertainty inherent in this emerging field, they took their time, demurring on
      high-testosterone bet-the-company antics."
  * "But deploying smart tactics, though complex and demanding, is not itself a strategy, and indeed any
    potential for Power remained opaque in those early days. For the time, Netflix could only stay alert and
    hope that Pasteur's dictum (["Chance Favors the Prepared Mind"]) would eventually bear fruit and chance
    would favor their prepared minds."
  * Netflix was able to afford original content because the cost to produce it was amortized across their
    large subscriber base. Less scaled competitors couldn't justify the investment on original content.
    * "In the Netflix eshxample we see a feature of Scale Economies that recurs in many technology firms: a
      single fixed cost which declines per unit as it is prorated over higher and higher volumes."
    * (Couldn't this be argued to be the case for all complex software, since it has zero marginal cost to
      service new users?)
  * Benefit: reduced cost
  * Barrier: prohibitive costs of share gains
  * To gain scale, an entrant must offer lower prices or better quality. A market leader will observe that,
    and price-match to prevent the erosion of their scale economies.
  * Other types of scale economies
    * Distribution network density
    * Learning economies: if learning leads to a product benefit, and it's positively correlated with
      production levels, then a scale advantage accrues to the leader.
      * (Liftoff had this data advantage against smaller DSPs, although the data advantage has diminishing
        returns with scale.)
      * Google Search has this.
    * Purchasing economies: when a large buyer can command lower prices, e.g. Wal-Mart.
* Network Economies (chap 2)
  * Examples: MS Windows, Facebook, LinkedIn
  * "Network Economies occur when the value of a product to a customer is increased by the use of the product
    by others."
  * Benefit: product is more valuable with each incremental user
  * Cost: value deficit of a follower can be prohibitive.
  * Common characteristics of Network Economies:
    * Winner takes all
    * Boundedness: "as powerful as this Barrier is, it is bounded by the character of the network, something
      well-demonstrated by the continued success of both Facebook and LinkedIn. Facebook has powerful Network
      Economies itself but these have to do with personal and not professional interactions. The boundaries of
      the network effects determine the boundaries of the business."
  * Indirect network effects (AKA demand side network effects)
    * "If a business has important complements and these complements are somehow exclusive to each offering,
      then a leader will attract more and/or better complements.
    * Examples: a mobile OS having a good app ecosystem, which a new entrant cannot replicate.
