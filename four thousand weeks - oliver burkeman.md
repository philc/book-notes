  * "The world is bursting with wonder," and we should spend more of our lives trying to experience that
    wonder.
* In the long run, we're all dead (intro)
  * Philosophers "have taken the brevity of life to be the defining problem of human existence: we've been
    granted the mental capacities to make almost infinitely ambitious plans, yet practically no time at all
    to put them into action."
  * No "productivity book" addresses the fundamental shortness of life.
  * "The world is bursting with wonder," and we should spend more of our lives trying to experience that
    wonder.
  * Time hacks do work, in a sense -- you will probably produce a greater quantity of shallow work -- and yet
    they leave you feeling more empty, because you're spending your life on busyness.
  * On the wrongness of how we spend time as children:
    * "Life, I knew, was supposed to be more joyful than this, more real, more meaningful, and the world was
      supposed to be more beautiful. We were not supposed to hate Mondays and live for the weekends and
      holidays. We were not supposed to have to raise our hands to be allowed to pee. We were not supposed to
      be kept indoors on a beautiful day, day after day."
  * Burkeman asserts that we will never increase our productivity to the point where we feel ahead,
    unpressured, with enough time to enjoy the important things in life, so we've already "lost" and should
    change the game that we're playing with our lives.
* The limit-embracing life (chap 1)
  * Experiencing "deep time" vs. "clock time": being fully present and fully alive to the experiences of the
    world, without conscious organization of time. Like children.
    * (Maybe I should put less pressure on my kids to count and understand time. Make it more about executive
      function and the sequence of activities, and less about budgeting).
  * He mentions the shift of labor during the industrial age from being compensated per task to per hour.
  * "Instead of simply living our lives as they unfold in time --instead of just being time, you might say --
    it becomes difficult not to value each moment primarily according to its usefulness for some future goal,
    or for some future oasis of relaxation you hope to reach once your tasks are finally 'out of the way.'"
  * "Eternity ceases gradually to serve as the measure and focus of human actions." - Mumford
  * "The trouble with attempting to master your time, it turns out, is that time ends up mastering you."
  * "We recoil from the notion that this is it -- that this life, with all its flaws and inescapable
    vulnerabilities, its extreme brevity, and our limited influence over how it unfolds, is the only one we'll
    get a shot at."
  * We mentally fight so that we don't have to feel constrained by reality. It's a form of neurosis and
    escapsism.
  * He argues that for most, increasing one's productivity is just a form of avoidance, to maintain hope that
    we can do all that we desire and won't face painful constraints of reality.
    * (I wonder if maintaining hope of achieving all the things, while unrealistic, is actually a useful
      mindset for bieng ambitious and for "striving well." I.e. aim for perfection so that you can achieve and
      be happy with "pretty good.")
  * "Most of us seek a specifically individualistic kind of mastery over time --our culture's ideal is that
    you alone should control your schedule, doing whatever you prefer, whenever you want -- because it's scary
    to confront the truth that almost everything worth doing, from marriage and parenting to business or
    politics, depends on cooperating with others,a nd therefore on exposing yourself to the emotional
    uncertainties of relationships."
  * (Related from 37 signals: FOMO vs. JOMO - joy of missing out)
  * "Freedom, sometimes, is to be found not in achieving greater sovereignty over your own schedule but in
    allowing yourself to be constrained by the rhythms of community -- participating in forms of social life
    where you *don't* get to decide exactly what you do or when you do it."
    * Letting go of control to participate in a community.
  * "So long as you continue to respond to impossible demands on your time by trying to persuade yourself that
    you might one day find some way to do the impossible, you're implicitly collaborating with those demands.
    Whereas once you deeply grasp that they *are* impossible, you'll be newly empowered to resist them, and to
    focus instead on building the most meaningful life you can, in whatever situation you're in."
* The efficiency trap (chap 2)
  * "You'll do what you can, you won't do what you can't, and the tyrannical inner voice insisting that you
    must do everything is simply mistaken."
  * "There are hard choices to be made: which balls to let drop, which people to disappoint, which cherished
    ambitions to abandon, which roles to fail at."
  * "The other exasperating issue is that if you succeed in fitting more in, you'll find the goalposts start
    to shift: more things will begin to seem important, meaningful, or obligatory."
  * He argues that acknowledging that you will never have the time needed for your important desires is the
    only helpful strategy. It's freeing. All else is denial, avoidance. All time management advice is
    predicated on the false notion that you can fit everything in, with the right strategy.
  * Parkinson's law applies to the whole sum of of what we deem important.
  * "This whole painful irony is especially striking in the case of email, that ingenious twentieth-century
    invention whereby any random person on the planet can pester you, at any time they like, and at almost no
    cost to themselves, by means of a digital window that sits inches from your nose, or in your pocket,
    throughout your working day, and often on weekends, too."
  * A belief in the afterlife lessens the pressure to "see it all" before you die.
  * Digital tools like Facebook, email, and dating sites help us more efficiently sort through choices but
    also expose us to unreal amounts of new choices.
  * Ticking things off of a bucket list suffers the same dynamic of any TODO list: it's infinite, and so
    making one's happiness tied to completion or progress will be unsatisfying.
  * "The more efficient you get, the more you become 'a limitless reservoir for other people's expectations.'"
    * The better you are at doing things, ironically, the more things you end up having to do.
* Facing finitude (chap 3)
  * (Beautiful chapter)
  * "As I make hundreds of smaller choices throughout the day, I'm building a life --but at one and the same
    time, I'm closing off the possibility of countless others, forever."
  * "Any finite life -- even the best one you could possibly imagine -- is therefore a matter of ceaselessly
    waving goodbye to possibility."
  * "For Heidegger, this is the central challenge of human existence: since finitude defines our lives, he
    argues that living a truly authentic life -- becoming fully human --means facing up to that fact."
    * Instead, we earnestly try to spend most of our days busy and distract ourselves from this fact.
  * "We try to avoid the intimidating responsibility of having to decide what to do with our finite time by
    telling ourselves that we don't get to choose at all -- that we must get married, or remain in a
    soul-destroying job."
  * When bouts with cancer teach us the scarcity of life and to live it more fully: "it pitches them into a
    more authentic mode of being, in which everything suddenly feels more vividly meaningful."
    * "Such experiences, however wholly unwelcome, often appear to leave those who undergo them in a new and
      more honest relationship with time. The question is whether we might attain at least a little of that
      same outlook in the absence of the experience of agonizing loss."
  * "When you're trying to Master Your Time, few things are more infuriating than a task or delay that's
    foisted upon you against your will."
    * Knowing that today's life is a gift rather than a day we're entitled to changed his experience of every
      day annoyances.
    * "It can seem amazing to be there at all, having any experience."
  * "Each moment of decision becomes an opportunity to select from an enticing menu of possibilities, when you
    might easily never have been presented with the menu to begin with."
  * We should not regret having to make the choice to pick only one of many valued activities; we should be
    thankful we get to pick one of them at all.
  * "It's precisely the fact that getting married forecloses the possibility of meeting someone else --
    someone who might genuinely have been a better marriage partner; who could ever say? -- that makes
    marriage meaningful."
* Becoming a better procrastinator (chap 4)
  * It's agonizing to confront that one's creative calling will be compromised by a romantic relationship;
    it's enough to cause bitterness, once the constraints become clear.
    * "Confining his relationship with Bauer to the realm of letters meant that he could cling to the
      possibility of a life of intimacy with her without allowing it to compete with his mania for work, as a
      real-life relationship necessarily would."
  * "When people finally *do* choose, in a relatively irreversible way, they're usually much happier as a
    result. We'll do almost anything to avoid burning our bridges, to keep alive the fantasy of a future
    unconstrained by limitation, yet having burned them, we're generally please that we did so."
    * Whether it be selecting a spouse, a career path, a job, a startup idea... it's simplifying to prune the
      space of possibility. It's exhausting to keep open so many possible branches.
  * "The 'joy of missing out': the recognition that the renunciation of alternatives is what makes their
    choice a meaningful one in the first place."
* The watermelon problem (chap 5)
  * The Ancient Greeks serious take on distraction: they "saw it less as a matter of external interruptions
    and more as a question of character -- a systematic inner failure to use one's time on what one claimed to
    value the most."
  * "Attention, on the other hand, just *is* life: your experience of being alive consists of nothing other
    than the sum of everything to which you pay attention. At the end of your life, looking back, whatever
    compelled your attention from moment to moment is simply what your life will have been."
    * So be wary of getting distracted, or giving attention to junk content.
  * "The crucial point isn't that it's wrong to choose to spend your time relaxing, whether at the beach or on
    BuzzFeed. It's that the distracted person isn't really choosing at all. Their attention has been
    commandeered by forces that don't have their highest interests at heart."
    * So we must develop the ability to exert some top-down control over our attention in the face of
      pre-empting forces.
  * The digital attention economy appropriates our attention with things that make us angry or horrified,
    because these things are hardest to ignore, and then it monetizes that attention via advertising. It's a
    leech.
    * (I think all subjects that are attention-grabbing, but return little value, are the same in this way:
      gossip, politics, news, fighting about our opinions / dogmatism).
  * "Unscrupulous politicians can overwhelm their opposition, not to mention the fact-checking capabilities of
    journalists, simply by flooding a nation's attentional bandwidth with outrage after outrage, so that each
    new scandal overwrites the last one in public awareness -- and anyone who responds or retweets, even if
    their intention is to condemn the hatemongering, finds themselves rewarding it with attention, thereby
    helping it spread." A pit of futility.
  * Despite the increasing effectiveness of social media nd the attention economy, ultimately we are choosing
    to be distracted and allowing it to happen. If we were really enamored with our most prioritized
    activities, and weren't fatigued, then we couldn't be pulled away from them.
