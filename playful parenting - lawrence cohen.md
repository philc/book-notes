* Jewels
  * "I find that it is often better to play at being incompetent instead of pretending to be fearful, since
    that seems to let the child loosen up and laugh about it more."
  * Parent is too busy to play right now
    * Very successful tactic: say "I don't have time right now; let's have a big hug and play in fifteen
      minutes." Like serving a snack after school to tide a child over until dinner, that extra contact helped
      the child manage the wait until she could get some attention from her parents.
  * Sportsmanship through hyperbole: set up a game where they will always win, and pretend to be a ridiculous
    figure of a sore loser.
  * Punishment
    * Parents may think they are giving a punishment (the yelling), but the child sees it as a reward (the
      reconciliation after yelling). If children don't know how to arrive at the reconciliation directly, they
      do it with bad behavior to prompt the yelling.
  * Empty threats: specially anxiety-arousing for children. We may know we would never leave them in the
      grocery store, but children aren't sure.
  * Games based on knowledge of a TV show or video game are less  universal and thus less inclusive.
  * Bind the children against you when they're fighting: grab the contentious toy and run, so they team up
    against you.
  * Children ask for the same play experience again because they remember that it brought them close to you.
  * Follow the giggles: "Giggles are the best form of laughter. Whatever triggers it, keep repeating it."
  * "Ask children to try to get *you* to laugh -- you'll get a good picture of what *they* think is funny."
  * Play out the situations where your child is impulsive: "let's play school", "let's play getting dressed
    and ready", "let's play bedtime routine."
  * Game: Larry's school of nonsense. More fun than playing "regular school." The parent is the teacher and
    makes up all kinds of ridiculous rules, which the kids break, and the teacher is then outraged/fusses.
    Rule breaking is always an interesting area of exploration for kids.
  * Fortunately/unfortunately game: fun word game, even for adults.
  * The concept of dedicated, intentional, regularly scheduled, uninterrupted Play Time with you, for your
    kids.
  * Patch Adams: make everything fun, even standing still in the grocery store line. "Unlike bribes, making
    everything fun fosters closeness, confidence, and cooperation."
  * Author's technique for bedtime separation: leave while they're still awake, but tell them you'll be back
    in 5 minutes to check on them, and if they're still awake, you'll lay down with them and do the cycle
    again. This removes the fear that you're going and you won't be back, and allows them to fall asleep.
  * Choose a "meeting on the couch" over a "time out". Unlike timeouts, usually everyone leaves the couch
    feeling better. Start with the mindset "we have a situation" not "my kid is misbehaving."
  * Parents may think they are giving a punishment (the yelling), but the child sees it as a reward (the
    reconciliation after yelling). If children don't know how to arrive at the reconciliation directly, they
    do it with bad behavior to prompt the yelling.

* The value of being a playful parent (chap 1)
  * Purpose of play
    * "We complain about children's short attention spans, but how long can we sit and play marbles or Barbies
      or Monopoly or fantasy games before we get bored and distracted, or pulled away by the feeling that
      getting work done or cooking dinner is more important?"
    * Maybe I would have more attention span if I loaded up a fantasy world in my head before engaging in make
      believe, for more immersion and direction.
    * Why do children play? It's a place -- "one of magic and imagination." Like our jobs, it's their full
      time occupation. Their mode of exploration. "Play is possible anywhere and anytime, a parallel universe
      of fantasy and imagination that children enter at will."
    * Why do we consider child labor such an abomination? Because it means children grow up without having a
      childhood and without play.
    * "Play serves the purpose of satisfying our incredible -- almost bottomless -- need for attachment and
      affection and closeness."
    * Every parent should master play. "If they don't think we will play, they may never ask. They just go about
      their business, and we go about ours, and we all miss chance after chance to reconnect."
  * Game for closeness: "the boy would have his parents sit on the couch; then he'd run toward them, landing
    right between them. They would then fight over who could grab him first, and it usually turned into a
    giggly human tug-of-war."
  * An example game for battling separation anxiety: "I won't play tennis. I'll stay here with you and take
    a nap. I'm soooo tied. What a comfy pillow." Lay on them and pretend to snore loudly. Wake up and ask
    "where's X? All I see is this lumpy pillow!"
  * "Out of desperation more than cleverness, I picked up two of her dolls and I made one of them say in a
    nasty voice: 'Oh, *she* can't get dressed by herself; *she* doesn't know how to get dressed by herself."
    Then I made the other one say, in a nice voice, 'She can so; she really can do it!'" His daughter would
    laugh, get dressed, and the nasty doll never seemed to manage to see her get dressed.
  * Fostering emotional recovery
    * Role reversal: let the child be the one in power. E.g. being the doctor and giving the parent or toy a
      shot, after coming home from shots.
  * Building empathy through play
    * "the daughter had classmates who were just beginning to learn English. This was fascinating to her, and
      for weeks, walking home from school, she would say, "Let's pretend we speak a different language." She
      and her father would speak gibberish to each other, pretending it was the language of some other
      country.
* Join children in their world (chap 2)
  * Game: let the toddler kick you while swinging, and fall over
    * "He would stand so that her feet just barely touched him on the chest. Then he would make a big show o
      falling over and pretending to be mad at her. He would get up and say 'You'd better not do that again!'"
    * "Why is this such a great game? It manages to cover all of the deep purposes of play: the contact, or
      near miss, is a great way to play with connection. Having the younger child be the more powerful one
      builds confidence. Having someone else fall down lets the toddler release all her frustration about
      walking."
  * Meeting the child in their world means going to their level and doing the kind of games and make-believe
    which is most fun for them.
  * Sometimes a parent must first lighten up before joining on the carpet for play after work. (How?)
  * Of course children should play by themselves or with friends part of the time. This fosters independence.
    But to fulfill the promise of play, kids needs adults to play with some of the time.
  * The importance of "getting down on the floor"
    * For younger kids, this means being at their eye-level.
    * For older kids, it means being on their turf, like the mall.
  * Why is it hard for adults to play?
    * Flabby play muscles, due to lack of use.
    * Emotional blocks or anxiety from life which is preventing them from letting loose.
  * Tune into children's needs: do they need help figuring something out? Are they too sleepy or hungry to
    think clearly? Do two children need a break from each other for a while? Do they need to be outside where
    they can be wilder? Too often we write children off saying they're just clamoring for attention, rather
    than understanding precisely what's going on.
  * Lava game:
    * Wrestle on the bed.
    * Floor is lava
    * Goal is to stay on the bed.
    * Kid: "sometimes we rescue each other and sometimes we push each other in." The kids would adjust the
      game to the prevailing emotions of the moment. That's tuning in.
  * Children ask for the same play experience again because they remember that it brought them close to you
    * "I guessed that the children experienced a very close, warm bond with him when he told them the story.
      Later, wanting to experience another shared moment with him, they ask for the same story again. Children
      rarely say 'Hey, that was great, let's do *something else*.' They almost always say 'Let's do that
      again.'"
* Establish a connection (Chap 3)
  * Where the wild things are: "This story has endured for two generations because children and parents alike
    are move by the full circle of human connection: the child violates the parent's rules, is punished, then
    uses fantasy to play out his feelings -- confident in the knowledge that he can return home to his
    mother's love."
  * "As babies grow, their explorations take them further and further afield, but those whose cups have been
    consistently filled always carry a strong sense of security within them. They are securely attached.
    Children who are not securely attached tend to be anxious and clingy, or withdrawn."
  * His lens on hyper-active kids: one interpretation of this behavior is that the kid is trying to get
    attention to refill their cup of attachment.
  * "Acting up and getting punished can be a way to get a refill if none is freely available. Unfortunately,
    the usual response, to ignore these children, makes them only more desperate for a refill."
  * "Mirroring" is a great game for building connection. Just don't make it feel like teasing.
  * For babies, peekaboo is the best game for exploring reconnection.
    * "If you experiment with the duration of time you hide during peekaboo, you can find exactly the length
      of time that brings the most giggles."
  * "Not many parents have experienced that profound bliss of deep, loving eye gazing with a child over age
    two. Not many even know it's possible to regain. We think that only babies do this, when we're playing
    deeply with them. But older kids can too, if we're as deeply engaged."
  * Game: the love gun
    * He invented this to allow him to connect with aggressive boys.
    * If they're using a gun as a toy, he says it's a love gun, and when shot, he has to love whoever shot
      him. "I open up my arms and take a step toward them with a big, goofy, lovestruck grin on my face."
    * "Sometimes they'll say 'No, this is a hate gun.' I just say 'Oh, it must be broken because it's making
      me love you."
    * "If they barricade themselves in a room, I slip love notes under the door and plead to be allowed in. If
      they come with both arms swinging, I say 'Oh, you want to dance.'"
  * Connection games "work best when the adult provides the insistence on connecting, but the child actually
    sets the terms of how the two are going to connect."
  * "Any play can be the doorway to connection. When a child pretends to shoot you and says 'You're dead,' try
    falling over dead, in a dramatic death scene, right on top of him. Grab his leg and beg him to bring you
    to a doctor. If the child squirms away, go into even more dramatic death throes that bring you right back
    on top."
  * Before you can begin instruction, or build character, the prereq is to be connected.
    * "Even if we don't like what we see when we tune in, we still have to tune in first.
* Encourage their confidence (chap 4)
  * Prepare your child for the world by both supporting and challenging them.
  * Let them experiment with power, e.g. rule-breaking of trivial made-up rules in a safe environment.
  * Game: "try to get past me to the couch." Building physical confidence and persistence.
  * Enjoying the terrible twos: learn to recognize and even enjoy the burst in independence, while providing
    the safety and structure of clear limits.
  * Sportsmanship through hyperbole: set up a game where they will always win, and pretend to be a ridiculous
    figure of a sore loser.
  * Adults are famous for taking all the fun and playfulness out of learning swimming or math, by using
    play or lessons that are too structured.
  * When kids lose interest in an activity like sculpture, they don't say "I'm not sure I'm good at it, can
    you help me get better?" they just say "I'm not interested anymore." We have to be detectives to gently
    ferret out whether they're feeling powerless and are struggling, or whether their interests have really
    changed.
* Follow the giggles (chap 5)
  * "Giggles are the best form of laughter. Whatever triggers it, keep repeating it."
  * Awesome: "ask children to try to get *you* to laugh -- you'll get a good picture of what *they* think is
    funny."
  * Chasing a child and repeatedly missing: "Why is this so funny? The outrageous claims make the adult into a
    fool, which is funny enough, but especially since it helps them feel more powerful."
  * "ha ha" game for couples (and parents and kids): standing very close, face-to-face, heels off the ground,
    bouncing lightly on the balls of your feet. Each person takes a turn saying "ha!" in a friendly voice,
    back and forth, until both are howling with real laughter. His thesis: face-to-face high energy fun is
    invaluable for reconnecting.
  * Sometimes kids have a negative emotional outpour after a play session: once they feel safe and close from
    all of the giggling, a slight at the end of the play session can trigger an emotional outpour. Don't
    mistake the slight as the cause of the emotions. It's healthy for them to let it out. Sit with them
    through it.
* Learn to Roughhouse (chap 6)
  * Provide basic safety. "Pushing and holding are more helpful in building confidence and connection than
    hitting. Your commitment to *no one* getting hurt, including yourself, builds feelings of safety that
    allow for effective wrestling."
    * This also extends to emotional safety: no humiliating the other person.
  * Find every opportunity for connection.
    * "If the child avoids eye contact, you might say, 'Before we battle to the death, let us do the ancient
      warrior custom of looking each other deep in the eyes.'"
    * There is a huge different between wrestling and punching a punching bag, and the difference can be
      summed up in two words: human connection.
  * Use every opportunity to play through old hurts.
    * "Replay:" For example, if a child had a disappointing defeat that day, let her replay it with you
      through wrestling. You represent the obstacle or bully. The object of the game is not necessarily for
      her to win this time around, that that can be helpful, but more important, to right all out with you
      cheering her on.
  * Stop when someone is hurt
    * "Interrupting wrestling --or any activity -- to pay attention to physical injuries is especially key for
      boys, who are often encouraged to be stoical and keep playing."
  * No tickling allowed
    * It's confusing: they're laughing and so seem to be enjoying it, but it's usually implemented with
      forceful control by the parent. Makes the child feel like the situation is out of their control. If they
      want to be tickled, do it sparingly with pokes, not an assault.
  * "Her mother would let her climb as high as she wanted, a confident smile on her face, trusting Emma's
    judgement. At the time, I thought this was horrible, but she was right. No broken bones. And I know, as a
    therapist, that even if she had broken a bone, bones heal faster than timidity and fearfulness."
  * Play out the situations where your child is impulsive. Just say "let's play school". "Let's play getting
    dressed and ready." "Let's play that you want this toy real bad, adn I won't share it with you." Take a
    real situation that is hard for them, label it as play, and let children practice gaining control over
    their impulses in ways that won't get them punished or humiliated.
* Suspend reality: reverse the roles (chap 7)
  * "Let's pretend that you're the day and I'm the daughter, and you're mad at me" -- a five-year-old girl to
    her angry father.
  * Playtime should let kids have the power for once: be the teacher, pin papa to the mat, enforce the bed
    time. The kid never has the power in life's situations until they're an adult.
  * On their first ski trip, you can make kids feel more competent by reversing the role of beginning and
    expert. If they fall, you can fall (hilariously) too.
  * Join storytelling: ask your child how the story should go at various points. This allows them to explore
    their fears and worries, without talking about them directly. E.g. the child creates terrifying dangers
    for the hero, and the parent invents a way to resolve them.
  * "If a child is afraid of bees, you might say 'You be a bee and I'll try to run away from you.' Let
    yourself get stung, and then scream." Or be an incompetent bee chasing the kid, and mistakenly sting
    yourself.
  * "I find that it is often better to play at being incompetent instead of pretending to be fearful, since
    that seems to let the child loosen up and laugh about it more."
  * Watching scary or suspenseful movies: "I find it's a good idea to take what I call scream breaks. Pause
    the movie and give a pretend scream, which will usually be followed by giggles. This break lets some of
    the feelings out, like the valve on a pressure cooker."
  * Game: Larry's school of nonsense. More fun than playing "regular school." The parent is the teacher and
    makes up all kinds of ridiculous rules, which the kids break, and the teacher is then outraged.
  * Most play situations just repeat closely what is seen on TV. Toys which are merchandised afford no
    flexibility in how they're used. E.g. a toy guy, a power ranger doll.
  * Beware shows that mix sex and violence. They can be overwhelmingly stimulating for kids and corrupt their
    imagination.
  * Children's play time is shortening: some children barely know how to play if they don't have a
    store-bought toy with them. Meanwhile, school days contain less and less play time, even in kindergarten,
    and more academic preparation."
* Empower girls and connect with boys (chap 8)
  * "Parenting has been described as the process of giving our children both roots and wings."
  * "Both closeness and confidence should be every child's birthright. But girls are discouraged from being
    too powerful, and they are encouraged to be overly nice, to care more about relationships than about
    achievement."
  * Fortunately/unfortunately game: in order to help boys to talk more, play simple word and language games.
    A favorite is fortunately/unfortunately: one person starts a story with Fortunately, says a line, then the
    next person says the next line, but starting with "unfortunately". You go back and forth telling a tale of
    disaster and rescue -- two important themes for most children.
  * Girls relay their concerns onto dolls in doll play.
  * "My favorite tactic with disengaged teenage girls is to say 'Okay, your turn.' They ask me what I mean. I
    tell them that they can talk about anything they want, or we can go anywhere they want. Then I want."
  * Some boys don't get the benefit of connection when wrestling or play fighting. They do karate moves, but
    there's no contact. Instead say "see if you can push me over. How about if we wrestle and we just use
    pushing."
* Follow your child's lead (chap 9)
  * "Just say yes". Most of the time we're in the mode of saying "no".
  * Let children try and fail
    * "Most situations in life aren't so drastic that children can't be allowed to figure them out on their
      own. It's like doing children's homework for them: the answers may be right, but they haven't learned
      anything. So instead of saying 'That won't work', try saying 'Let's try it and see.'"
    * You will be seen as an ally, not as a naysayer.
  * Give them dedicated "Play Time" with you
    * Structured, intentional 1:1 time where the child leads. "Go deep into their territory".
    * This intentional, prescribed time helps the child anticipate and plan for it, and the parents to be
      extra intentional once it begins. Kids often save up emotional issues to be worked through during this
      time.
      * "You don't answer the phone or cook dinner or take a nap during Play Time."
    * Dedicated play time with each child helps sibling rivalry recede.
    * Play time can be hard if we don't like the games selected, or it's boring. And we're always pulled
      towards our own priorities -- work, chores, etc. Take time to renew after playtime. It's hard. Treat it
      like deliberate practice; focus.
    * If the kid is able to play by themselves, e.g. they move your piece around the monopoly board for you,
      that's not an excuse to leave. Your job is to stay awake. That's the type of play your kid wanted at
      that moment.
    * Your kid communicates through play. Imagine if you don't engage, or keep interrupting and changing the
      game on them. "We've all had the experience of wanting to tell someone something, but they keep
      interrupting or changing the subject or telling us what to do or how to feel. We hate it, yet we do it
      to children all the time."
  * Be safe, but don't worry too much
    * Regulating their play when it's dangerous: "That scares me. Let's see if we can figure out a way to do
      it safely. If we can't, we'll have to forget it.
* Take charge when necessary (chap 10)
  * In short, join the activity on their terms, and steer it towards connecting.
  * You can provide a gentle push to connect if the play isn't set up properly:
    * "The next thing we need to do is connect: how do you think we ought to do it?" Children who aren't used
      to being asked this question may need some ideas or suggestions about how to reconnect, such as hugging,
      looking in each other's eyes, shaking hands, wrestling, giving a high-five. Children who have been asked
      a few times generally have very clear ideas about how they want to connect.
  * "Make every encounter into a two-way exchange"
    * If a child is building a tower and ignoring you, rather than building your own tower in isolation,
      collect all the blocks so she has to ask you for blocks. Or pick up blocks and ask how to build a tower
      with them. Or build a goofy tower but fail until she instructs you on what to do.
  * "Holding time" to force closeness during aggression. (This is controversial)
    * If a child won't stop hitting or biting, gently but firmly restrain them. This is often enough to bring
      a healing flood of tears. The emotional release is typically followed by a new level of closeness. With
      "firm holding", the contact and the pressure and the safety help children to organize their sensations
      and impulses.
  * Introduce important themes into play
    * Like playing "school drop off" at home, to defang it and remove separation anxiety.
    * Example themes: potty training, punishment, separation anxiety, bed time, including others, sharing.
    * "Having the child's dolls or stuffed animals act out exclusion and rejection is my favorite way to
      introduce this theme."
    * "Birthday party lists are not a time to empower children; they are a time to guide them, especially when
      it comes to exclusion based on race or class, or exclusion of a scapegoat or outcast."
      * If you want your child to be friends with someone, the parents should invite their whole family over.
  * Make it fun
    * Why don't we treat chores as fun? It's just a mindset.
    * Patch Adams: "the file room of the Navy Federal Credit Union in Anacostia might seem like an unlikely
      place to thrive."
    * "I used to get upset at long lines and stuff, but now Seth and I can have a great time in line at the
      supermarket."
    * "Bribes are not the same as making the activity fun. In fact, bribes backfire, making it even less
      likely that children will want to do something on their own initiative, whether it is getting up in the
      morning, or studying in school, or doing chores. Unlike bribes, making everything fun fosters closeness,
      confidence, and cooperation."
* Learn to love the games you hate (chap 11)
  * Excess dependency / clinginess
    * Children are used to being sent away and they dread it. Every time they come close, they are already
      tense about the impending separation.
    * Role reversal: try clinging to the child.
    * Author's technique for bedtime separation: leave while they're still awake, but tell them you'll be back
      in 5 minutes to check on them, and if they're still awake, you'll lay down with them and do the cycle
      again. This removes the fear that you're going and you won't be back, and allows them to fall asleep.
  * Children acting like babies:
    * Their cup gets filled by a brief excursion into babyhood. Go along with it. "Oh, what an enormous baby!
      I've never seen one so big in my life."
  * Loosen up about rules that don't matter:
    * E.g. if you kid wants to cover themselves in bandaids... let them; who cares?
    * Power struggles disappear if we don't fight over them.
  * Game: make up pretend rules which are silly, and fuss when the kid breaks them. Rule breaking is always an
    interesting area of exploration for kids.
  * Game: "Arwen's monopoly": let your kid make up the rules of monopoly. The kid will end up giving
    themselves big wads of money. It's all good. "I pretended to be surprised with each new rule that emerged,
    and how it benefit her and not me!"
  * Violent games
    * You can't expect to ban games about symbolic aggression, like war or power rangers. Best to join and
      transform it into a productive game.
  * Sexually themed play
    * Kids who get exposed to more than they can handle try to cope with it in play. They'll usually play some
      sex-themed game in secret with another kid. If you discover this, have a conversation about sex and
      answer their questions candidly, and reduce their exposure at home.
  * Parent is too busy to play right now
    * Very successful tactic: say "I don't have time right now; let's have a big hug and play in fifteen
      minutes." Like serving a snack after school to tide a child over until dinner, that extra contact helped
      the child manage the wait until she could get some attention from her parents.
* Accept strong feelings (chap 12)
  * Be careful about repressing emotions; ensure they come out. ("Big boys don't cry.")
  * Sometimes you have to ask the kid to repeatedly tell the story about how they got hurt, so they can
    release emotion. The first time they tell it may be very short.
  * Author recommends not letting children cry themselves to sleep, alone. Don't "cry it out." Use a better
    tactic. Infants are not trying to manipulate their parents into sleeping with them.
  * Kid's exuberance
    * We get annoyed because kids are loud and excited. Send them outside, but don't suppress it. "Soon you'll
      be nostalgic for that childhood energy... join in the fun. It will be good for you, for the children,
      and your relationship with them."
  * Giving in to tantrums
    * Be careful not to dogmatically hold your ground during a tantrum.
    * "We may feel suck; we don't want to give into the tantrum. We need to be willing to change our minds if
      our no was unreasonable. Children can tell the difference between caving into their screaming versus
      reconsidering our position."
  * Working out fear through RPGs
    * "Let's pretend we're going to the dentist."
    * "That was really scary last night; let's play a game about it."
* Rethink the way we discipline (chap 13)
  * Cool off: effective discipline rarely happens in the heat of the moment.
  * Make a connection
    * Author sees most misbehavior as a matter of disconnection. Ask yourself: is their cup empty?
    * Instead of reaching for punishment, which tends to create an even bigger disconnection, try thinking
      about how to reestablish connection: when's the last time you did Play Time?
  * Choose a "meeting on the couch" over a "time out"
    * It's a break you take together, rather than the parent imposing their will on the child.
    * Start with the mindset "we have a problem" rather than "my kid is misbehaving."
    * Unlike punishment, usually everyone leaves the couch feeling better.
    * Timeouts:
      * Children fear banishment, and will fight the time out even more. They will make pathetic promises to
        be better, which they can't keep, because they were made out of ear.
      * Timeouts do get kids attention, which is required for connection, but they are less hostile ways to
        get their attention.
    * "I've never seen anyone punished into being good. Bribes don't work either."
    * Parents may think they are giving a punishment (the yelling), but the child sees it as a reward (the
      reconciliation after yelling). If children don't know how to arrive at the reconciliation directly, they
      do it with bad behavior to prompt the yelling.
  * Instill good judgement
    * More scalable than "obedience in specific situations".
    * Comes from talking about how they might handle certain situations, discussing moral dilemmas.
  * Look underneath the surface, at the child's needs
    * See if you can find the need that drove the bad behavior. None of those needs are met with punishment.
      * "You are lonely, so I'm going to send you to your room."
      * "You are feeling disconnected, so I'm going to hit you."
      * "You're hungry, so I'm going to take your toys away instead of feeding you."
    * Punishment enters the scene because of our own feelings: I am mad, so I'm going to yell at you.
  * Kids behave as kids. Or they're just different from their parents. Ask yourself, would a third party
    observer think the kid was doing something wrong enough to deserve punishment? Don't abuse your power as
    the bigger person.
  * Empty threats
    * Especially anxiety-arousing for children. We may know we would never leave them in the grocery store,
      but children aren't sure.
* Play your way through sibling rivalry (chap 14)
  * Not all suffering is worthy of intervention:
    * "Children need to get into arguments to learn how to resolve them; they must be excluded from groups to
      learn group entry skills."
  * Bind combative children together, against you
    * When they're fighting over a toy, take it and run, and become the bad guy. Give them bait to join forces.
    * "I don't do it all the time since they also need to figure out how to negotiate with each other."
  * Games based on knowledge of a TV show or video game are less  universal and thus less inclusive.
  * Much sibling conflict can be seen as trying to steal a refill from their siblings cup. If you refill their
    cup more frequently, stealing becomes less necessary.
* Recharge your own batteries (chap 15)
  * It's hard to be a playful parent if you're exhausted, bored, or your kid is acting like a brat. You need
    to come into it with a full cup.
  * Cure: have someone listen to you. A therapist, or just a friend (and take turns swapping listening duty).
  * Good listening:
    * take turns, be confidential, don't judge anything they say. Don't interrupt and say "me too" and launch
      into your own story.
    * Let the emotions flow. Don't try to make the other person shove them back inside. "Don't worry, there's
      nothing to be upset about!"
  * Public meltdowns
    * When parents themselves or kids are having a meltdown in a public place, go over and help. We tend to
      turn away in disgust.
    * "She saw a father screaming at a little girl for dripping ice cream from her cone onto her dress. She
      stepped over and said, very calmly, "you can't talk to her that way." "Why the hell not?" "Because
      you're scaring her. Look at her."
  * Thinks playing a game to get the kids through their chores is actually more time-efficient than chasing
    and nagging them through it.
  * "Always make up after a fight. Offer forgiveness without being asked. When things are rough between you,
    spend more time together instead of less. As a way to resolve conflict, offer a hug instead of the usual
    punishment."
  * Stop being boring: "don't ask your poor children those automatic questions -- "did you wash your hands?"
    years ago I learned to stop doing this. I would try to tell her something interesting, some gossip or
    colorful story, and my kid would perk right up."
  * For play dates, recommends that children play, and adults take turns listening to each other about
    parenting anxieties. This lets the parents refuel their cups.
