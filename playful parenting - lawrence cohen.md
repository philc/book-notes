* The value of being a playful parent (chap 1)
  * "We complain about children's short attention spans, but how long can we sit and play marbles or Barbies
    or Monopoly or fantasy games before we get bored and distracted, or pulled away by the feeling that
    getting work done or cooking dinner is more important?"
    * Maybe I would have more attention span if I loaded up a fantasy world in my head before engaging in make
      believe. For more immersion and direction.
  * Why do children play? It's a place -- "one of magic and imagination." Like our jobs, it's their full time
    occupation. Their mode of exploration. "Play is possible anywhere and anytime, a parallel universe of
    fantasy and imagination that children enter at will."
  * Why do we consider child labor such an abomination? Because it means children grow up without having a
    childhood, without play.
  * "Play serves the purpose of satisfying our incredible -- almost bottomless -- need for attachment and
    affection and closeness."
  * Game for closeness: "the boy would have his parents sit on the couch; then he'd run toward them, landing
    right between them. They would then fight over who could grab him first, and it usually turned into a
    giggly human tug-of-war."
  * An example game for battling separation anxiety: "I won't play tennis. I'll stay here with you and take
    a nap. I'm soooo tied. What a comfy pillow." Lay on them and pretend to snore loudly. Wake up and ask
    "where's X? All I see is this lumpy pillow!"
  * "Out of desperation more than cleverness, I picked up two of her dolls and I made one off them say in a
    nasty voice: 'Oh, *she* can't get dressed by herself; *she* doesn't know how to get dressed by herself."
    Then I made the other one say, in a nice voice, 'She can so; she really can do it!'" His daughter would
    laugh, get dressed, and the nasty doll never seemed to manage to see her get dressed.
  * Fostering emotional recovery
    * Role reversal: being the one in power. E.g. being the doctor and giving the parent or toy a shot; after
      coming home from shots.
  * Building empathy through play
    * "the daughter had several classmates who were just beginning to learn English. This was fascinating to
      her, and for weeks, walking home from school, she would say, "Let's pretend we speak a different
      language." She and her father would speak gibberish to each other, pretending it was the language of
      some other country.
  * Every parent should master play. "If they don't think we will play, they may never ask. They just go about
    their business, and we go about ours, and we all miss chance after chance to reconnect."
* Join children in their world (chap 2)
  * Great game idea: let the toddler kick you while swinging, and fall over
    * "He would stand so that her feet just barely touched him on the chest. Then he would make a big show o
      falling over and pretending to be mad at her. He would get up and say 'You'd better not do that again!'"
    * "Why is this such a great game? It manages to cover all of the deep purposes of play: the contact, or
      near miss, is a great way to play with connection. Having the younger child be the more powerful one
      builds confidence. Having someone else fall down lets the toddler release all her frustration about
      walking."
  * Meeting the child in their world means going to their level and doing the kind of games and make-believe
    which is most fun for them.
  * Sometimes a parent must first lighten up before joining on the carpet for play after work. (How?)
  * Of course children should play by themselves or with friends part of the time. This fosters independence.
    But to fulfill the promise of play, kids needs adults to play with some of the time.
  * The importance of "getting down on the floor"
    * For younger kids, this means being at their eye-level.
    * For older kids, it means being on their turf, like the mall.
  * Why is it hard for adults to play?
    * Flabby play muscles, due to lack of use.
    * Emotional blocks or anxiety from life which is preventing them from letting loose.
  * Tune into children's needs: do they need help figuring something out? Are they too sleepy or hungry to
    think clearly? Do two children need a break from each other for a while? Do they need to be outside where
    they can be wilder? Too often we write children off saying they're just clamoring for attention, rather
    than understanding precisely what's going on.
  * Lava game:
    * Wrestle on the bed.
    * Floor is lava
    * Goal is to stay on the bed.
    * Kid: "sometimes we rescue each other and sometimes we push each other in." The kids would adjust the
      game to the prevailing emotions of the moment. That's tuning in.
  * Children ask for the same play experience again because they remember that it brought them close to you
    * "I guessed that the children experienced a very close, warm bond with him when he told them the story.
      Later, wanting to experience another shared moment with him, they ask for the same story again. Children
      rarely say 'Hey, that was great, let's do *something else*.' They almost always say 'Let's do that again.'"
* Establish a connection (Chap 3)
  * Where the wild things are: "This story has endured for two generations because children and parents alike
    are move by the full circle of human connection: the child violates the parent's rules, is punished, then
    uses fantasy to play out his feelings -- confident in the knowledge that he can return home to his
    mother's love."
  * "As babies grow, their explorations take them further and further afield, but those whose cups have been
    consistently filled always carry a strong sense of security within them. They are securely attached.
    Children who are not securely attached tend to be anxious and clingy, or withdrawn."
  * His lens on hyper-active kids: one interpretation of this behavior is that the kid is trying to get
    attention to refill their cup of attachment.
  * "Acting up and getting punished can be a way to get a refill if none is freely available. Unfortunately,
    the usual response, to ignore these children, makes them only more desperate for a refill."
  * "Mirroring" is a great game for building connection. Just don't make it feel like teasing.
  * For babies, peekaboo is the est game for exploring reconnection.
    * "If you experiment with the duration of time you hide during peekaboo, you can find exactly the length
      of time that brings the most giggles."
  * "Not many parents have experienced that profound bliss of deep, loving eye gazing with a child over age
    two. Not many even know it's possible to regain. We think that only babies do this, when we're playing
    deeply with them. But older kids can too, if we're as deeply engaged.
  * The love gun
    * A game he invented which allows him to connect with aggressive boys.
    * If they're using a gun as a toy, he says it's a love gun, and when shot, he has to love whoever shot
      him. "I open up my arms and take a step toward them with a big, goofy, lovestruck grin on my face."
    * "Sometimes they'll say 'No, this is a hate gun.' I just say 'Oh, it must be broken because it's making me
      love you."
    * "If they barricade themselves in a room, I slip love notes under the door and plead to be allowed in. If
      they come with both arms swinging, I say 'Oh, you want to dance.'"
  * Connection games "work best when the adult provides the insistence on connecting, but the child actually
    sets the terms of how the two are going to connect."
  * "Any play can be the doorway to connection. When a child pretends to shoot you and says 'You're dead,' try
    falling over dead, in a dramatic death scene, right on top of him. Grab his leg and beg him to bring you
    to a doctor. If the child squirms away, go into even more dramatic death throes that bring you right back
    on top."
  * Before you can begin instruction, or build character, the prereq is to be connected.
    * "Even if we don't like what we see when we tune in, we still have to tune in first.
* Encourage their confidence (chap 4)
