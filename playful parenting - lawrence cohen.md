* The value of being a playful parent (chap 1)
  * "We complain about children's short attention spans, but how long can we sit and play marbles or Barbies
    or Monopoly or fantasy games before we get bored and distracted, or pulled away by the feeling that
    getting work done or cooking dinner is more important?"
    * Maybe I would have more attention span if I loaded up a fantasy world in my head before engaging in make
      believe. For more immersion and direction.
  * Why do children play? It's a place -- "one of magic and imagination." Like our jobs, it's their full time
    occupation. Their mode of exploration. "Play is possible anywhere and anytime, a parallel universe of
    fantasy and imagination that children enter at will."
  * Why do we consider child labor such an abomination? Because it means children grow up without having a
    childhood, without play.
  * "Play serves the purpose of satisfying our incredible -- almost bottomless -- need for attachment and
    affection and closeness."
  * Game for closeness: "the boy would have his parents sit on the couch; then he'd run toward them, landing
    right between them. They would then fight over who could grab him first, and it usually turned into a
    giggly human tug-of-war."
  * An example game for battling separation anxiety: "I won't play tennis. I'll stay here with you and take
    a nap. I'm soooo tied. What a comfy pillow." Lay on them and pretend to snore loudly. Wake up and ask
    "where's X? All I see is this lumpy pillow!"
  * "Out of desperation more than cleverness, I picked up two of her dolls and I made one off them say in a
    nasty voice: 'Oh, *she* can't get dressed by herself; *she* doesn't know how to get dressed by herself."
    Then I made the other one say, in a nice voice, 'She can so; she really can do it!'" His daughter would
    laugh, get dressed, and the nasty doll never seemed to manage to see her get dressed.
  * Fostering emotional recovery
    * Role reversal: being the one in power. E.g. being the doctor and giving the parent or toy a shot; after
      coming home from shots.
  * Building empathy through play
    * "the daughter had several classmates who were just beginning to learn English. This was fascinating to
      her, and for weeks, walking home from school, she would say, "Let's pretend we speak a different
      language." She and her father would speak gibberish to each other, pretending it was the language of
      some other country.
  * Every parent should master play. "If they don't think we will play, they may never ask. They just go about
    their business, and we go about ours, and we all miss chance after chance to reconnect."
* Join children in their world (chap 2)
  * Great game idea: let the toddler kick you while swinging, and fall over
    * "He would stand so that her feet just barely touched him on the chest. Then he would make a big show o
      falling over and pretending to be mad at her. He would get up and say 'You'd better not do that again!'"
    * "Why is this such a great game? It manages to cover all of the deep purposes of play: the contact, or
      near miss, is a great way to play with connection. Having the younger child be the more powerful one
      builds confidence. Having someone else fall down lets the toddler release all her frustration about
      walking."
  * Meeting the child in their world means going to their level and doing the kind of games and make-believe
    which is most fun for them.
  * Sometimes a parent must first lighten up before joining on the carpet for play after work. (How?)
  * Of course children should play by themselves or with friends part of the time. This fosters independence.
    But to fulfill the promise of play, kids needs adults to play with some of the time.
  * The importance of "getting down on the floor"
    * For younger kids, this means being at their eye-level.
    * For older kids, it means being on their turf, like the mall.
  * Why is it hard for adults to play?
    * Flabby play muscles, due to lack of use.
    * Emotional blocks or anxiety from life which is preventing them from letting loose.
  * Tune into children's needs: do they need help figuring something out? Are they too sleepy or hungry to
    think clearly? Do two children need a break from each other for a while? Do they need to be outside where
    they can be wilder? Too often we write children off saying they're just clamoring for attention, rather
    than understanding precisely what's going on.
  * Lava game:
    * Wrestle on the bed.
    * Floor is lava
    * Goal is to stay on the bed.
    * Kid: "sometimes we rescue each other and sometimes we push each other in." The kids would adjust the
      game to the prevailing emotions of the moment. That's tuning in.
  * Children ask for the same play experience again because they remember that it brought them close to you
    * "I guessed that the children experienced a very close, warm bond with him when he told them the story.
      Later, wanting to experience another shared moment with him, they ask for the same story again. Children
      rarely say 'Hey, that was great, let's do *something else*.' They almost always say 'Let's do that again.'"
