* Gems
  * "We all yearn for a role in one of the heroic scripts of the tales with which we grew up, or a
    role in one of the great events of history. We all crave an authentic experience of exploration,
    discovery, or superhuman achievement."
  * Scathing account of what it means to be a tourist
    * "The tourist seeks immediate gratification and entertainment... his main interest is to visit
      major sites in order to be photographed there, or to attend special cultural events, often
      especially created for the tourist industry. It is difficult, if not impossible, for him to
      immerse himself in the foreign culture or delve into the actual realities of the country."
    * "Above all, the tourist returns home the same person he left."
    * Examples: business trips; 3 day exploration of a city with a group of people
  * On long-term travel: "Time is the yeast of the Fermentation of Experience."
  * "His old world begins to fade away both physically and psychologically. He feels free to roam
    the world without constraints of culture, upbringing, or education. We may liken this to cutting
    the umbilical cord that ties the traveler to his own country and culture."
  * Argues every organism in this world is provided for, so no one is going to die from going
    outside their comfort zone. Mass tourism provides a feeling of safety that's unnecessary.
  * Humans are the "highest expression of life" on the planet and should be at the center of an
    explorer's journey, which is to understand human nature.
  * "There is a universal principle at work whereby the difficulties one has to solve are
    proportionate to the things one must learn. The more rare and novel the difficulties, the more
    precious and long-lasting the gifts they bear. Every difficulty can teach us something new about
    ourselves and our relationships with other people."
  * The ugly things of the world -- landscapes, towns -- provide the contrast needed to appreciate
    the beautiful.
  * Deferral of judgement about human behavior, aesthetics, architecture, and cleanliness allows us
    to experience the place and culture and process it later.
  * "Solitude is the prerequisite for true, authentic togetherness. For unless we discover
    ourselves, we cannot truly relate to others in depth."
  * "I found that gathering these activities into whole days was better for me. It allowed my travel
    days (the first and most important on the list) to be more pure and untainted by other
    activities, such as running errands or planning. So I ended up having travel days, planning
    days, study days, errands days, and rest days."
    * (Might this be a framework for how I carve up my home life with the kids?)
* Destination Earth (chap 1)
  * We can consider our planet to be "Destination Earth", in the same way that we currently think
    about the moon or Mars.
    * "Our planet then ceases to be an aggregate of countries and immediately becomes a *single
      destination* with a great variety of landscapes and natural beauty, numberless human cultures,
      a myriad of animals and plants, and an inexhaustible wealth of happenings. We may then call
      out with all of our might: 'I'm traveling to Earth!'"
  * "We all yearn for a role in one of the heroic scripts of the tales with which we grew up, or a
    role in one of the great events of history. We all crave an authentic experience of exploration,
    discovery, or superhuman achievement."
  * "World travel will become one of the most revolutionary social phenomena that will define the
    twenty-first century."
    * For the first time ever, it's easy and affordable for the middle class, and there's prevailing
      interest in multi-cultural understanding.
  * About a lightning storm he witnessed in Mexico
    * "The lightning show, the scale and beauty of which no human fireworks show could ever equal,
      made me realize that Nature's Art is on a completely different level than anything we humans
      create. I pondered why we were willing to pay for a ticket to attend spectacular shows but so
      often choose to ignore the free, extraordinary displays of Nature. The answer seemed to lie in
      our having become accustomed to receiving Nature's endless gifts and, like spoiled children
      who get many toys, no longer appreciating them."
    * Pretending that the lightning storm was a show put on for spectators (created by God for his
      child), to break the pattern of taking things for granted:
      * "In the surrounding fields there were thousands of technicians with specialized equipment
        who were all busy working to create this one-of-a-kind light show just for me and some other
        invisible guests! The 'just another ordinary natural phenomenon' immediately morphed into a
        'uniquely extraordinary human event' -- no chance natural phenomenon, but the greatest human
        light show ever conceived that was being created for my own pleasure."
  * Destination Earth is the most fascinating planet to explore. We can travel back in time to study
    ancient civilizations. We can travel to bizarre worlds like Alaska, volcanoes, and the reefs.
    Visiting ancient sites feels like time travel.
  * A gush for Japanese culture: "It is not just the technological advancements of the Japanese that
    set them apart. Often bypassed are their social mores: the way they rear their children, their
    sophisticated and detailed rules of propriety, their sense of aesthetics in everyday tasks,
    their elaborate work ethic, and their advanced sense of duty."
* World travel (chap 2)
  * Watching a video about a place vs. actually visiting it: "it's akin to the relationship between
    seeing a photo of a person you love and having the actual person next to you."
  * "One must create the time to study, ask questions, and interact with locals. One may also devote
    time to visit a Zen monastery, a Shogun castle, a Shinto temple, a kaiseki restaurant. The more
    time one devotes to these, the more dimensions of the Japanese culture will begin to unfold. The
    traveler will soon start seeing the world through Japanese eyes, so to speak, and start to feel
    what it means to be Japanese."
  * One dimensional travel (point or line travel)
    * Seeing a tourist highlight on an inflexible schedule.
    * No substantive contact with locals.
    * See "stereotypical elements of a culture."
    * Scathing account of what it means to be a tourist
      * "The tourist seeks immediate gratification and entertainment... his main interest is to
        visit major sites in order to be photographed there, or to attend special cultural events,
        often especially created for the tourist industry. It is difficult, if not impossible, for
        him to immerse himself in the foreign culture or delve into the actual realities of the
        country."
      * "Above all, the tourist returns home the same person he left."
      * Examples: business trips; 3 day exploration of a city with a group of people
  * Two-dimensional travel (surface travel)
    * A program with some freedom in it, linked together by a travel agency. A prepped "tour",
      superficial.
  * Three-dimension travel (solid travel)
    * Long-term.
    * 3+ weeks spent exploring an area.
    * Lots of freedom to adapt based on what's "in the field."
    * Plan made by the traveler after careful study
  * Four-dimensional travel (total travel)
    * Never a holiday.
    * Delve into the soul of a country
    * Struggle with the culture and logistics to better understand it.
    * Long-term
    * (This is demanding and doesn't sound enjoyable, nor is it accessible for most people. Is it
      even possible with kids? What about job and school? Maybe as a once-a-decade experience.)
  * Have the experience of the rich and poor alike
    * "Only by adopting an all-encompassing approach and embracing what is central in each region
      and culture can one truly experience the real world in all its aspects."
  * "This transformative element of Time is the crucial quality that distinguishes short- from
    long-term travel and gives the latter its added transformational dimension."
    * "Time is the yeast of the Fermentation of Experience."
    * Long-term travel gives the traveler the ability to distance himself from the world he is
      leaving behind.
  * "His old world begins to fade away both physically and psychologically. He feels free to roam
    the world without constraints of culture, upbringing, or education. We may liken this to cutting
    the umbilical cord that ties the traveler to his own country and culture."
  * Argues every organism in this world is provided for, so no one is going to die from going
    outside their comfort zone. Mass tourism provides a feeling of safety that's unnecessary.
    * "After a few months of travel, every long-term traveler begins to experience this self-evident
      and ever-present reality of a *providing world*."
    * The world is safe; people are friendly and want to help. We all belong to the same group:
      humanity.
  * "The world is infinite in relation to the finite capabilities of a single human being. This,
    coupled with cumulative fatigue, which is the result of both a physical and psychological
    overstretch after years on the move, makes the traveler understand that his journey can never
    accomplish its original target. There is no way a world-traveler may ever actually know the
    world completely."
* A new philosophy of travel (chap 3)
  * Magnification
    * Magnification, like a telescope, as a conceptual measurement of travel depth. Magnification is
      largely bounded by time available.
    * "It lies at the heart of planning, and it secretly guides the way one travels, the speed of
      travel, and the mode of exploration."
    * Magnification can be infinitely large; infinite depth. Many spend a whole lifetime learning
      about a place, its people, and their history, and they never learn it all.
    * "There must be some law of diminishing returns that appears somewhere along this seemingly
      infinite line of increasing magnification. The person living in China for 20 years will not
      learn twice as much about China during the second decade of his residence."
    * The right magnification of a country depends on its size and complexity, and one's personal
      interest in the country.
      * (For me, feudal Japan warrants grater magnification than say Taiwan).
  * The Wise-Line
    * The path that one takes when exploring a country or place. "A 'wise line' captures the
      country's most characteristic landscapes, villages, towns, and cultures."
      * A representative cross section of the country.
    * "It is thus experiencing only the small part of a country which goes through the lens of their
      narrow interests. But a long-term traveler ought to strive for the opposite: to broaden his
      interests and expand his field of exploration, so that he may discover new things to love and
      be passionate about!"
    * The joker in the journey pack is "being open to surprise."
      * "By being open to surprise -- unexpected encounters, events, abrupt changes in plans -- he
        stays in harmony with the flow of Life."
  * Capturing the soul
    * This means somehow becoming a new member of the culture being visited.
    * "Experiencing what it means to be a member of another society allows you to transcend your
      national limitations and to supplant your narrow way of seeing the world with a new vision."
    * Humans are the "highest expression of life" on the planet and should be at the center of an
      explorer's journey: understanding human nature.
  * "The whole of Life is the field of exploration of the world-traveler. The whole of Life means
    everything -- the difficulties, problems, and pitfalls that are included in the actual act of
    traveling, plus the disturbing and painful aspects of the world."
  * On abject poverty and other topics: "The traveler must learn to *accept* the annoying incidents
    in the journey and the unpleasant realities of the world as constituting the dark side of the
    bipolar reality of existence. He must then go a step further: instead of judging, rejecting, or
    avoiding contact with them, he should consciously and intentionally embrace them."
  * "There is a universal principle at work whereby the difficulties one has to solve are
    proportionate to the things one must learn. The more rare and novel the difficulties, the more
    precious and long-lasting the gifts they bear. Every difficulty can teach us something new about
    ourselves and our relationships with other people."
  * The ugly things of the world -- landscapes, towns -- provide the contrast needed to appreciate
    the beautiful.
  * Argues we cannot right injustices while traveling
    * "If he decides that he must become involved in such noble pursuits, this must be done after
      his travels. Traveling is a work unto itself. It is impossible to introduce such grand
      endeavors in one's life while on the move."
  * Deferral of judgement about human behavior, aesthetics, architecture, and cleanliness allows us
    to experience the place and culture and process it later.
  * Start seeking to find the interesting questions to understand the tapestry of life, rather than
    relentlessly pursuing answers. He argues that travel can be a vehicle for the reversion to a
    child's "beginner mindset."
  * "Becoming"
    * A traveler lives mostly in solitude. He's not immersed in the local life; he's an explorer.
      He's in the world but not of the world.
    * The traveler is a hermit immersed in the world, just as a hermit is a spiritual traveler
      withdrawn from the world."
    * "Solitude is the prerequisite for true, authentic togetherness. For unless we discover
      ourselves, we cannot truly relate to others in depth."
    * Argues that a sedentary life is focused on doing, accomplishing. One's day is full of must-do
      obligations. A traveling life is one that is focused on transformation. That is what a
      traveler "does" with their life.
    * "In order to *do* anything of value, one must first *become* able to do it. It is in this
      sense that Becoming is primary and Doing is secondary. It is who you are that creates what you
      do. The greatest people among us, whom we admire and venerate, first set out to become
      themselves; by becoming themselves, their doing became the fruition or expression of who they
      were. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony *is* Beethoven."
      * (This sounds like to me like travel is about focusing on one's Production Capacity -- one's
        views and capabilities -- in preparation for Producing).
    * Four central elements in the experience of Becoming:
      * "Being in the present moment, aliveness, openness, and freedom."
    * "What is unique with travel, however, is that unlike all meditative, yogic, or spiritual
      practices, it *forces* one to be in the present moment. The new, the surprising, the alien,
      make the traveler become so absorbed in whatever he sees and experiences that he cannot help
      but be in the present moment."
    * "When one concentrates on important work or creates something meaningful, which absorbs him
      completely, or when one is captivated by a piece of art or music, he is fully present in the
      now."
  * "This sense of absolute freedom is something we all had when we were children and then lost at
    some point. As children, we had endless time to discover, play, and wonder."
  * Facing "empty, unstructured time" is like a writer facing a blank page. It's daunting.
  * "By choosing his own constraints in a conscious and responsible manner, a traveler constantly
    lives with the maximum freedom possible and, at the same time, with the best and most pleasant
    limitations there are -- which are those he chooses on his own and for himself."
    * (Sounds like the blessed fruits of anyone who is in charge of their time, and chooses wisely)
* Parallels between a travel-journey and our life's journey (chap 4)
  * "The belief that our life has some aim and meaning, just as a journey has a destination and a
    specific quest, has inspired novelists, poets..."
  * On including all of the things you love in your life, but at different levels of commitment
    * "Just as it is unnecessary to visit every single sight or attraction a country has to offer,
      it is not necessary to live to the fullest every possible life we could possibly lead. Rather,
      we may decide to keep many of our loves, and thus our potential lives, by incorporating them
      into a single path in *different magnifications*."
* Planning an around-the-world journey (appendix)
  * (An interesting exercise of drawing a wise-line across Europe to experience the essence of this
    continent. Makes me want to explore.)
  * It would be cool to follow a year-long program to tour the world's most beautiful / important
    places.
  * "In Rome, for example, one may find buildings or structures from almost every century of the
    last 2,500 years!"
    * We might forget, living in America, how rich is Europe's axis of history.
* A glimpse into the actual days of a world traveler (appendix)
  * "I found that gathering these activities into whole days was better for me. It allowed my travel
    days (the first and most important on the list) to be more pure and untainted by other
    activities, such as running errands or planning. So I ended up having travel days, planning
    days, study days, errands days, and rest days."
  * "The greatest magnification of exploration becomes possible when actually *walking* in a town or
    a village."
  * On being invited to a home for dinner or a sleepover.
    * These will be deep, rich, vibrant memories.
    * "Such precious and rare encounters are little epiphanies and worth their active pursuit."
