# Suburban Nation - Andres Duany, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, Jeff Speck

## Intro

* (Is "good growth" possible? NIMBYism is understandable because for most cities and suburban
  communities, growth makes the existing environment worse.
* There are beloved towns like Carmel, but over the past 100 years we've made places like that
  illegal to build, through building codes. E.g. forbidding mixed use.
* Will growth produce a "placeless collection of strip centers and office parks", or "real towns
  with real neighborhoods?"
* The problem is a lack of design. "We live today in cities and suburbs whose form and character we
  did not choose. They were imposed upon us, by federal policy, local zoning laws, and the demands
  of the mobile."

## What is sprawl, and why? (chap 1)

* Traditional neighborhood vs. sprawl:
  * Traditional: pedestrian friendly. Daily needs are within walking distance.
  * Sprawl: "carefully separated pods of single use." Daily needs are within driving distance.
* "The dominant characteristic of sprawl is that each component is strictly segregated from the
  others."
* Five components of sprawl
  * Housing subdivisions
    * "Subdivisions can be identified as such by their contrived names, which tend toward the romantic
      -- Pheasant Mill Crossing -- and often pay tribute to the natural or historic resource they have
      displaced." (ouch)
  * Shopping centers, aka big box retail
    * These are "all places which one is unlikely to walk."
  * Office parks
    * "More likely to be surrounded by highways than countryside."
  * Civic institutions; schools
    * "In traditional neighborhoods, these buildings often serve as neighborhood focal points," but
      in sprawl they are "surrounded by parking, and located nowhere in particular."
  * Roadways
    * Since each activity of daily life is separated, we must drive to engage in each activity.
    * "Since most of this motion takes place in singly occupied automobiles, even a sparsely
      populated area can generate the traffic of a much larger traditional town."
    * There's a high pavement:building ratio.
