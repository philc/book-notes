* Gems
  * Over his life, he's learned to love the struggles
    * "In time, I realized that the satisfaction of success doesn't come from achieving your goals, but from
      struggling well. To understand what I mean, imagine your greatest goal, whatever it is -- making a ton
      of money, winning an Academy Award, running a great organization, being great at a sport. Now imagine
      instantaneously achieving it. You'd be happy at first, but not for long. You would soon find yourself
      needing something else to struggle for."
  * My life as a game
    * "I have found it helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in which each problem I face is a
      puzzle I need to solve. By solving the puzzle, I get a gem in the form of a principle that helps me
      avoid the same sort of problem in the future. Collecting these gems continually improves my decision
      making, so I am able to ascend to higher and higher levels of play in which the game gets harder and the
      stakes become even greater."
  * Pain + Reflection = Progress
    * "Though this process of pushing your limits, of sometimes failing and sometimes breaking through --
      and deriving benefits from both your failures and your successes -- is not for everyone, if it is for
      you, it can be so thrilling that it becomes addictive. Life will inevitably bring you such moments, and
      it'll be up to you to decide whether you want to go back for more."
  * Weigh second and third-order consequences
    * Nature sorts people by those who respond to first order consequences (they will fail) vs. those who
      respond to second order (they will succeed)
      * "Quite often the first-order consequences are the temptations that cost us what we really want, and
        sometimes they are the barriers that stand in our way. It's almost as though nature sorts us by
        throwing us trick choices that have both types of consequences and penalizing those who make their
        decisions on the basis of the first-order consequences alone."
    * Examples
      * Exercise: pain is the 1st order; health and attractiveness are the second.
      * Rich food: good taste is the first order; lethargy and weight gain are the second.
  * Radical open-mindedness requires you to replace your attachment to always being right with the joy of
    learning what's true.
    * Instead, learn to take joy in obtaining the best data for your decisions.
  * "Ask yourself: am I seeing this just through my own eyes? If so, then you should know that you're terribly
    handicapped."
    * The best answer to a problem can rarely be entirely produced by you. Gather inputs so you can cover
      every angle.
  * "If you had asked me what my objective was when I started out, I would've said it was to have fun working
    with people I like. Work was a game I played with passion and I wanted to have a blast playing it with
    people I enjoyed and respected."
  * Be radically open-minded
    * Closed-minded people focus much more on being understood than on understanding others. Open-minded
      people feel compelled to see things through others' eyes.
    * Closed-minded people are more likely to make statements than ask questions.
  * Habits
    * "If you do just about anything frequently enough over time, you will form a habit that will control you.
      Good habits are those that get you to do what your 'upper-level you' wants, and bad habits are those
      that are controlled by your 'lower-level you' and stand in the way of getting what your 'upper-level
      you' wants. You can create a better set of habits if you understand how this part of your brain works.
      For example, you can develop a habit that will make you 'need' to work out at the gym."

* Intro
  * Principles: fundamental truths, grouped by life situation, so you can iterate on your strategy for those
    situations and get what you want.
  * We get principles through experience and parents. Religion and legal frameworks provide holistic packages
    of principles.
  * As a kid, "I got excited about visualizing things to go after". Then developed principles in response to
    failure.
  * "I believe that the key to success lies in knowing how much to both strive for a lot and fail well."
  * "Experience taught me how invaluable it is to reflect on and write down my decision-making criteria
    whenever I made a decision, so I got in the habit of doing that. With time, my collection of principles
    became like a collection of recipes for decision making."
    * Eventually I could express my decision-making criteria as algorithms to embed in computers.
  * Part I: where I'm coming from
    * "Over the course of our lives, we make millions and millions of decisions that are essentially bets,
      some large and some small."
    * You are naturally gifted with intelligence, but decision making abilities (i.e. wisdom) must be acquired
      through "encounters with reality."
* My call to adventure (chap 1, 2, 3)
  * Grew up in the 1960s, which was an era of great ambition. Inspirational. Kennedy's space race.
  * Learned how to be "radically open-minded" so he could gather high-quality disagreement and convince
    himself of the best idea.
    * "I sought out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their reasoning."
    * "This experience led me to build Bridgewater as an idea meritocracy -- not an autocracy in which I lead
      and others follow, and not a democracy in which everyone's vote is equal -- but a meritocracy that
      encourages thoughtful disagreements and explores and weighs people's opinions in proportion to their
      merits."
  * Pulling Bridgewater out of China after a year's experiment
    * "I don't regret my choice. I learned that if you work hard and creatively, you can have just about
      anything you want, but not everything you want. Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in
      order to pursue even better ones."
  * The joy and value of "seeing the world through someone else's eyes"
    * "I love seeing the world through other people's eyes... this is true whether they are rich or poor."
      (example of person in Papua New Guinea, and world economic leaders). "Encounters like these have taught
      me that human greatness and terribleness are not correlated with wealth or other conventional measures
      of success. I've also learned that judging people before really seeing things through their eyes stands
      in the way of understanding their circumstances -- and that isn't smart. I urge you to be curious enough
      to want to understand how the people who see things differently from you came to see them that way. You
      will find that interesting and invaluable, and the richer perspective you gain will help you decide what
      you should do."
  * "I believe that all organizations basically have two types of people: those who work to be part of a
    mission, and those who work for a paycheck. I wanted to surround myself with people who needed what I
    needed, which was to make sense of things for myself."
  * Theme: be skeptical of black and white dichotomies which may be false.
    * Should Bridgewater stay a boutique or become a big institution? "I felt about this fork-in-the-road
      choice the way I felt about most others -- that whether or not we could have our cake and eat it too was
      merely a test of our creativity and character. For example, I could envision ways in which technology
      would help us get the most out of people" (and not become bloated).
    * "I didn't like the alternative of not allowing ourselves to become all we could be."
  * "Another one of those"
    * "Whenever something new came along that required me to make a decision, I would reflect on my criteria
      for making that decision and write it down as a principle so people could make the connections between
      the situation, my principle for handling these situations, and my actions. More and more, we saw
      everything as 'another one of those' -- another of a certain type of situation like hiring, firing,
      determining compensation, dealing with dishonesty -- that had principles for handling them."
      * Making his decision making about how to run the business into a concrete algorithm, so it was
        transparent and repeatable. Just like their investment strategy: underlying each principle was an
        overarching philosophy, which was also written down.
  * Recordings of meetings where decisions were considered and taken were edited, and then used as boot camps
    for new hires.
  * Baseball cards
    * He created a card for everyone in the company with their "stats" for all to see. E.g. Myers Biggs data.
      "Overwhelmingly positive". Sounds ballsy. This allowed the team to achieve better skill-task alignment.
  * He struggled to help his bipolar son, who made it out OK.
    * "That journey through hell gave me a much deeper understanding of how and why we see things differently.
      I learned that much of how we think is physiological and can be changed."
  * In 2008 he had two full time jobs: managing investments, and managing the business. He calculated that it
    would take 165 hours to do each well, and so he couldn't have one person fill both rolls.
    * "To me, the greatest success you can have as the person in charge is to orchestrate others to do things
      well without you. A step below that is doing things well yourself."
  * "Suck the marrow out of life"
    * At 60, he wanted to set up Bridgewater to run without him. He wanted to remain head of the investment
      arm, hand operational control over to someone else, and pursue his hobbies and family and friends. He
      wanted to "suck the marrow out of life."
* Returning the boon (chap 6)
  * The third phase of life
    * "In the third and last phase of life, when others no longer depend on us and we no longer have to work,
      we are free to savor life."
      * Would moving from phase 2 to 3 make me happy, or sorrowful?
      * His framing of "work as a game" makes it possible to still enjoy and be amazing at work until you die.
        The difference in phase 3 is you want to afford yourself the luxury of getting out of the critical
        path and not be essential, because this affords you greater latitude in your pursuits.
    * "I wasn't going to stop playing the markets, because that's a game I've loved playing since I was twelve
      and I will keep playing until I die. But I didn't want to be *needed* in either role, because of the
      key-man risk that would create for the company."
      * I wonder if "chairman of the board" or some role that's interesting but less on the critical path than
        CEO is a better role for one's happiness. Wouldn't Musk want to be Chief Inventor of Tesla rather than
        CEO?
    * "As I write these words in 2017, I view this year as the final one in my transition from the second
      phase of my life to the third, when I will have finished passing along the knowledge I have gathered
      along the way, and, as Joseph Campbell described it, I will be free to live and free to die. But right
      now I'm not thinking about the dying part; I'm thinking about how to live freely, and I'm excited about
      it."
  * Systematizing our idea meritocracy
    * The vision: have good data on people's merits, and a playbook for management scenarios which could take
      that data and produce good management decisions which matched merit to responsibility.
    * "It is now clear to me that the main difference behind why the investment management part of Bridgewater
      is likely to continue to do well and most of the other parts of Bridgewater are unlikely to do as well
      (if we don't change how we are operating) is that the decision-making processes for investment
      management have been so systemized that it's hard for people to screw them up (because they are largely
      following the systems' instructions) while the other areas of Bridgewater are much more dependent on the
      quality of the people and their decision making."
  * Anticipating the European debt crisis
    * He saw it coming, explained it painstakingly to policy makers, recommended counter measures, and the
      worst was avoided. Published a video to make this kind of education easier.
    * "I came to respect most of the policymakers I worked with and to feel sorry for them because of the
      terrible positions they were in. Most are highly principled people who are forced to operate in
      unprincipled environments."
    * Policy makers must maximize their country's well being, or even more narrowly, their constituents' well
      being, and this prevents them from cooperating over long time frames or seeing the full picture and
      optimizing that.
  * At this point in his life he's realized that he needs to pay it forward. "You can't take it with you when
    you die."
  * The hero's journey
    * Call to adventure
    * Crossing the threshold
    * The road of trials
    * Abyss
    * Metamorphosis
    * The ultimate boon
    * Returning the boon
  * Wrestling with the questions of philanthropy
    * "Imagine being faced with the choice between a big night out on the town or saving a child's life. That
      was essentially the choice we constantly faced."
    * "We wanted to do our philanthropy together, as a family activity, which has proven to be fabulous."
    * Questions one must answer:
      * How much money to give to your kids, such that they have little enough that they can learn to struggle
        and become strong from it?
      * How many of your generations should you budget to protect?
    * "While we have felt compelled to help, we've discovered it is very difficult to have a significant
      impact relative to the size of the problem."
      * E.g. how to sustainably help 10k disadvantaged kids convert into positive contributors to society?
    * "Giving away the money that I acquired during my lifetime -- and doing that well -- has been a joy, a
      challenge, and the appropriate thing to do at this stage in my life."
* Looking back from a higher level (Chap 8)
  * Over his life, he learned to "love his struggles" because each was an important opportunity to grow and
    develop timeless principles.
    * "In time, I realized that the satisfaction of success doesn't come from achieving your goals, but from
      struggling well. To understand what I mean, imagine your greatest goal, whatever it is -- making a ton
      of money, winning an Academy Award, running a great organization, being great at a sport. Now imagine
      instantaneously achieving it. You'd be happy at first, but not for long. You would soon find yourself
      needing something else to struggle for."
  * "I cannot say that having an intense life filled with accomplishments is better than having a relaxed life
    filled with savoring. I can say that being strong is better than being weak, and that struggling gives one
    strength."
    * "Being well-known is probably worse than being anonymous, all things considered."
    * The burden of being famous and having resources is immense.
* Embrace reality and deal with it (Chap 9)
  * My life as a game
    * "I have found it helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in which each problem I face is a
      puzzle I need to solve. By solving the puzzle, I get a gem in the form of a principle that helps me
      avoid the same sort of problem in the future. Collecting these gems continually improves my decision
      making, so I am able to ascend to higher and higher levels of play in which the game gets harder and the
      stakes become even greater."
  * Be a hyper-realist
    * "Reality is beautiful", so he appreciates the beauty of even harsh situations and all of the
      cause-and-effect relationships which drive them.
    * Dreams + Reality + Determination = A Successful Life
  * Truth -- an accurate understanding of reality -- is the essential foundation for any good outcome
  * Be radically open-minded and radically transparent
    * Be unbiased towards reality, so there is no obstruction preventing you from learning from it.
    * Don't feel guarded with how you feel and what you think of reality. It will cause misunderstandings and
      is inefficient.
  * Look to nature to learn how reality really works
    * "Most people are like ants, focusing on themselves and their own ant hill."
    * "While mankind is very intelligent in relation to other species, we have the intelligence of moss
      growing on a rock compared to nature as a whole. We are incapable of designing and building a mosquito,
      let alone all the species and most of the other things in the universe. So I start from the premise that
      nature is smarter than I am and try to let nature teach me how reality works."
    * He's looked to nature and the common themes of all animals to put the human struggle into perspective.
    * (He has an evolutionary worldview)
  * "Don't get hung up on your views of how things "should" be because you will miss out on learning how they
    really are."
  * "Evolving is life's greatest accomplishment and its greatest reward"
    * Striving is its own goal and reward.
    * Reality is optimizing for the whole -- not for you
      * What's best for the world is what's rewarded, and what will happen. Inventions that benefit the masses
        are rewarded. People die to make way for the young.
    * It is a fundamental law of nature that in order to gain strength one has to push one's limits, which is
      painful.
  * Pain + Reflection = Progress
    * "If you can develop a reflexive reaction to psychic pain that causes you to reflect on it rather than
      avoid it, it will lead to your rapid learning/evolving."
      * This is the ultimate habit: reacting to pain to make it into a growth opportunity, so that you can
        grow from challenges and losses
      * "Though this process of pushing your limits, of sometimes failing and sometimes breaking through --
        and deriving benefits from both your failures and your successes -- is not for everyone, if it is for
        you, it can be so thrilling that it becomes addictive. Life will inevitably bring you such moments,
        and it'll be up to you to decide whether you want to go back for more."
    * Go to the pain rather than avoid it
    * Embrace tough love
      * Helping those he cares for to "struggle well"
      * "I will often deny them what they 'want' because that will give them the opportunity to struggle so
        that they can develop the strength to get what they want on their own."
      * "This can be difficult for people emotionally, even if they understand intellectually that having
        difficulties is the exercise they need to grow strong and that just giving them what they want will
        weaken them and ultimately lead to them needing more help."
    * Even huge, permanent setbacks can be fuel for growth and happiness, because striving against the setback
      and making gains is rewarding. The setback becomes a tool for you; an aid to your striving.
      * "The quality of your life will depend on the choices you make at those painful moments."
  * Weigh second and third-order consequences
    * Examples
      * Exercise: pain is the first order; health and attractiveness are the second.
      * Rich food: good taste is the first order; lethargy and weight gain are the second.
    * "Nature" poses trick questions for the important matters. Many consistently fail. Those who can focus on
      the second order will hit their goals and succeed.
    * "Don't let pain stand in the way of your progress."
      * Instead, understand how to manage pain to produce progress.
    * Nature sorts people by those who respond to first order consequences (they will fail) vs. those who
      respond to second order (they will succeed)
      * "Quite often the first-order consequences are the temptations that cost us what we really want, and
        sometimes they are the barriers that stand in our way. It's almost as though nature sorts us by
        throwing us trick choices that have both types of consequences and penalizing those who make their
        decisions on the basis of the first-order consequences alone."
  * Look at the machine from the highest level
    * Distinguish between you as the designer of your machine and you as a worker with your machine
      * "To be successful, the "designer/manager you" has to be objective about what the "worker you" is
        really like, not believing in him more than he deserves, or putting him in jobs he shouldn't be in."
    * Think of yourself as a set of machines and you have the ability to alter your machines to produce better
      outcomes.
    * Successful people can go above themselves to see things objectively and manage those things to shape
      change
      * Get outside of yourself, out of your own head with your own biases.
      * "Watching people struggle and having others watch you struggle can elicit all kinds of ego-driven
        emotions such as sympathy, pity, embarrassment, anger, or defensiveness. You need to get over all that
        and stop seeing struggling as something negative."
      * You are not the best at everything. Sometimes you should hand over a responsibility in your life to
        someone else and trust them.
      * "Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is a great skill that you should
        develop no matter what, as it will help you develop guardrails that will prevent you from doing what
        you shouldn't be doing." (I haven't been great at this).
* Use the 5-step process to get what you want out of life (chap 19)
  * Have clear goals
    * While you can have virtually anything you want, you can't have everything you want.
    * "Life is like a giant smorgasbord with more delicious alternatives than you can ever hope to taste."
    * Desires are typically first-order consequences. Don't confuse goals with desires.
    * Never rule out a goal because you think it's unattainable. Very few are completely unattainable. They
      get unlocked with more knowledge.
    * Remember that great expectations create great capabilities. Larger gaps produce better solutions.
  * Identify and don't tolerate problems
    * "View painful problems as potential improvements that are screaming at you."
    * Each problem you face is an opportunity. The painful ones are the greatest opportunities.
    * Don't avoid confronting problems because they are rooted in harsh realities that are unpleasant to look
      at.
      * I think he's advising to weed out the emotion of shame if it's preventing you from overcoming your
        pride, acknowledging poor performance, and troubleshooting.
    * "Once you identify a problem, don't tolerate it. You need to develop a fierce intolerance of badness of
      any kind, regardless of its severity."
      * Well said. This is the emotion that's triggered in me when I see bugs, see our system fall down, or a
        debugging workflow is harder than it should be.
      * I could use this framing a lot more in my life. "Why don't I have an efficient go-to healthy snack?
        I've gone long enough without it."
  * Diagnose problems to get at their root causes
    * Problem-solvers jump right to solution brainstorming once a problem is identified. Instead,
      diagnose/analyze it for 15m. Flesh out the picture of the problem, so you can see the root causes and
      become equipped to think strategically.
  * Design a plan that will get you around the problems
    * Think about your problem as a set of outcomes produced by a machine.
      * This distances yourself from the performance you currently have, and helps reveal how to close the
        gaps. Be objective and dispassionate.
    * "Movie script model": think of your plan as being like a movie script in that you visualize who will do
      what through time.
      * Start with coarse goals; layer in granularity, then plot all of the actions over time.
  * Push through to completion
    * Do what's necessary to push these designs through to results
  * Weakness doesn't matter if you find solutions
    * Everyone has at least one big thing that stands in their way of success. Each person typically fails at
      one particular step in this five step process more often than the others. Which part are you the most
      weak?
    * "Humility can be even more valuable than having good mental maps if it leads you to see out better
      answers than you could come up with on your own. Having both open-mindedness and good mental maps is
      most powerful of all."
    * On a grid of "what you know" vs. "humble & open-minded", you want to be in the upper right.
* Be radically open-minded (chap 20)
  * Have humility.
  * Optimize through data collection. That will build your confidence in your decision making, and yield
    better decisions.
  * Recognize your two barriers: your ego and your blind spots.
    * The lower brain exerts desires and emotions which are hidden from the prefrontal cortex, and thus hard
      to correct or control.
  * Radical open-mindedness requires you to replace your attachment to always being right with the joy of
    learning what's true.
    * Instead, learn to take joy in obtaining the best data for your decisions.
  * The ability to perform well when you don't have the knowledge is more important than having tons of
    knowledge.
    * "Sincerely believe that you might not know the best possible path and recognize that your ability to
      deal well with 'not knowing' is more important than whatever it is you do know."
  * Open-mindedness requires true, non-judgmental empathy.
  * "Ask yourself: am I seeing this just through my own eyes? If so, then you should know that you're terribly
    handicapped."
    * The best answer to a problem can rarely be entirely produced by you. Gather inputs so you can cover
      every angle.
  * Appreciate the art of thoughtful disagreement
    * Where both people step outside themselves and explore the other's view, to ensure they are not wrong.
      The goal is not conflict, or to persuade, and you must learn to do this so others don't feel like it's a
      conflict.
    * "In thoughtful disagreement, your goal is not to convince the other party that you are right -- it is to
      find out which view is true and decide what to do about it. In thoughtful disagreement, both parties are
      motivated by the genuine fear of missing important perspectives."
    * "To me, it's pointless when people get angry with each other when they disagree because most
      disagreements aren't threats as much as opportunities for learning. People who change their minds
      because they learned something are the winners, whereas those who stubbornly refuse to learn are the
      losers."
    * Dalio prefers to ask questions in this type of dialogue, rather than make statements.
  * Triangulate your view with believable people who are willing to disagree
  * Recognize the signs of closed-mindedness and open-mindedness that you should watch out for
    * Closed-minded people block others from speaking. If it seems like someone isn't leaving space for the
      other person in a conversation, it's possible they are blocking. To get around blocking, enforce the
      "two minute rule": each person can speak for at least two minutes before being interrupted.
    * Closed-minded people focus much more on being understood than on understanding others. Open-minded
      people feel compelled to see things through others' eyes.
    * Closed-minded people are more likely to make statements than ask questions.
    * A few good decision makers working effectively together can significantly outperform a good decision
      maker working alone.
* Understand that people are wired differently (chap 21)
  * We're wired differently -- that's the reality. So how do we take that into account when collaborating to
    find out what is true?
  * Self-interest vs. collective interest: "Wilson explains that man is perpetually suspended between the two
    extreme forces that created us: Individual selection which prompted sin, and group selection which
    promoted virtue."
  * Habitual behavior is driven by the basal ganglia.
    * "If you do just about anything frequently enough over time, you will form a habit that will control you.
      Good habits are those that get you to do what your 'upper-level you' wants, and bad habits are those
      that are controlled by your 'lower-level you' and stand in the way of getting what your 'upper-level
      you' wants. You can create a better set of habits if you understand how this part of your brain works.
      For example, you can develop a habit that will make you 'need' to work out at the gym."
  * "The most valuable habit I've acquired is using pain to trigger quality reflections. If you can acquire
    this habit yourself, you will learn what causes your pain and what you can do about it, and it will have
    an enormous impact on your effectiveness."
  * Thinking vs. feeling
    * "Some people make decisions based on logical analysis of objective facts... other people focus on
      harmony between people. They are better suited to roles that require lots of empathy, interpersonal
      contact, and relationship building, like HR and customer service."
    * Before they understood this at Bridgewater, conversations between Ts and Fs could be really frustrating.
      "Now we laugh as we bump up against our differences."
  * "Getting the right people in the right roles in support of your goal is the key to succeeding at whatever
    you choose to accomplish"
* Learn how to make decisions effectively (chap 22)
  * The biggest threat to good decision making is harmful emotions
  * Decision making is a two-step process: learning and then deciding
  * Synthesize the decision at hand
    * "One of the most important decisions you can make is who to ask questions of"
      * "Listening to uninformed people is worse than having no answers at all."
    * "New is overvalued relative to great. For example, when choosing which movie to watch or what book to
      read, are you drawn to proven classics or the newest big thing? In my opinion, it is smarter to choose
      the great over the new."
    * Don't over-generalize from too few data points.
  * Synthesize the situation through time
    * Focus on the right level of detail -- usually higher level than you think. Stay out of the weeds.
    * Be imprecise; embrace the phrase "by and large" to describe patterns.
      * Focusing on the details when doing macro analysis is the wrong approach.
      * People who volunteer exceptions which are unimportant distract the conversation. This wastes time.
    * Perfectionists spend too much time on little differences at the margins at the expense of the important
      things.
  * Navigate levels effectively
    * When making decisions, use the level appropriate for each decision. (Think of Google Map's zoom
      feature).
    * Use the terms "above the line" and "below the line" to establish which level a conversation is on
      * "An above-the-line conversation addresses the main points and a below-the-line conversation focuses on
        the sub-points. When a line of reasoning is jumbled and confusing, it's often because the speaker has
        gotten caught up in below-the-line details without connecting them back to the major points. An
        above-the-line discourse should progress in an orderly and accurate way to its conclusion, only going
        below the line when it's necessary to illustrate something about one of the major points."
  * Make your decisions as expected value calculations
    * Rather than favoring outcomes which are most probable. Many of us hate losses, even if the magnitude is
      small, but that's not correctly optimizing.
    * Raising the probability of being right is valuable no matter what your probability of being right
      already is.
      * Going from 80% confidence to 90% confidence halves the number of losses you will have. So gather more
        information to make you convert some of your losses into wins.
  * Prioritize by weighing the value of additional information against the cost of not deciding
    * "You need to constantly evaluate the marginal benefit of gathering more information against the marginal
      cost of waiting to decide."
  * Use principles
    * "Almost all 'cases at hand' are just 'another one of those', identifying which 'one of those' it is, and
      then applying well-thought-out principles for dealing with it. This will allow you to massively reduce
      the number of decisions you have to make."
    * "Make it a game to identify which pattern a new situation represents, and thus which principles should
      be brought to bear."
* Intro to work principles (chap 23)
  * Write out concrete values of what the org is about, and the rationale for each, before hiring others, and
    ensure they align with what the org stands for. It's how you can ensure hte people will want to be
    together long-term.
  * Mental model of a machine operator
    * The operator looks down on the machine from a higher level, and repeatedly assesses whether the outcomes
      are consistent with the goals, and when not, tunes the machine.
    * The machine has two parts: culture and people.
  * "If you had asked me what my objective was when I started out, I would've said it was to have fun working
    with people I like. Work was a game I played with passion and I wanted to have a blast playing it with
    people I enjoyed and respected."
    * He considered his team as partners, not employees.
  * "The main test of a great partnership is not whether the partners eve disagree -- people in all healthy
    relationships disagree --but whehter they can bring their disagreements to the surface and get through
    them well. Having clear processes for resolving disagreements efficiently and clearly is essential for
    business partnerships, marriages, and all other forms of partnership."
  * "Bridgewater is the opposite of a cult: the way it works is to maximally encourage independent thinking."
