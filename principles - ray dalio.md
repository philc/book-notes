* Intro
  * Principles: fundamental truths, grouped by life situation, so you can iterate on your strategy for those
    situations and get what you want.
  * We get principles through experience, parents; religion and legal frameworks provide holistic packages of
    principles.
  * As a kid, "I got excited about visualizing things to go after". Then developed principles in response to
    failure.
  * "I believe that the key to success lies in knowing how much to both strive for a lot and fail well."
  * "Experience taught me how invaluable it is to reflect on and write down my decision-making criteria
    whenever I made a decision, so I got in the habit of doing that. With time, my collection of principles
    became like a collection of recipes for decision making."
    * Eventually I could express my decision-making criteria as algorithms to embed in computers.
  * Part I: where I'm coming from
    * "Over the course of our lives, we make millions and millions of decisions that are essentially bets,
      some large and some small."
    * You are naturally gifted with intelligence, but decision making abilities (i.e. wisdom) must be acquired
      through "encounters with reality."
* My call to adventure (chap 1, 2, 3)
  * Grew up in the 1960s, which was an era of great ambition. Inspirational. Kennedy's space race.
  * Learn how to be "radically open-minded" so he could gather high-quality disagreement and convince himself
    of the best idea.
    * "Seek out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their reasoning."
    * "this experience led me to build Bridgewater as an idea meritocracy -- not an autocracy in which I lead
      and others follow, and not a democracy in which everyone's vote is equal --but a meritocracy that
      encourages thoughtful disagreement sand explores and weighs people's opinions in proportion to their
      merits."
  * Pulling Bridgewater out of China after a year's experiment
    * "I don't regret my choice. I learned that if you work hard and creatively, you can have just about
      anything you want, but not everything you want. Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in
      order to pursue even better ones."
  * The joy and value of "seeing the world through someone else's eyes"
    * "I love seeing the world through other people's eyes... this is true whether they are rich or poor."
      (example of person in Papua New Guinea, and world economic leaders). "Encounters like these have taught
      that human greatness and terribleness are not correlated with wealth or other conventional measures of
      success. I've also learned that judging people before really seeing things through their eyes stands in
      the way of understanding their circumstances -- and that isn't smart. I urge you to be curious enough to
      want to understand how the people how see things differently from you came to see them that way. You
      will find that interesting and invaluable, and the richer perspective you gain will help you decide what
      you should do."
  * "I believe that all organization basically have two types of people: those who work to be part of a
    mission, and those who work for a paycheck. I wanted to surround myself with people who needed what I
    needed, which was to make sense of things for myself."
  * Theme: be skeptical of black and white dichotomies which may be false.
    * Stay a boutique or become a big institution? "I felt about this fork-in-the-road choice the way I felt
      about most others -- that whether or not we could have our cake and eat it too was merely a test of our
      creativity and character. For example, I could envision ways in which technology would help us get the
      most out of people" (and not become bloated).
    * "I didn't like the alternative of not allowing ourselves to become all we could be."
  * "Another one of those"
    * "Whenever something new came along that required me to make a decision, I would reflect on my criteria
      for making that decision and write it down as a principle so people could make the connections between
      the situation, my principle for handling these situations, and my actions. More and more, we saw
      everything as 'another one of those' -- another of a certain type of situation like hiring, firing,
      determining compensation, dealing with dishonesty -- that had principles for handling them."
      * Making his decision making about how to run the business into a concrete algorithm, so it was
        transparent and repeatable. Just like their investment strategy: underlying each principle was an
        overarching philosophy, which was also written down.
