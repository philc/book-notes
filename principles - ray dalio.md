* Gems
  * Over his life, he's learned to love the struggles
    * "In time, I realized that the satisfaction of success doesn't come from achieving your goals,
      but from struggling well. To understand what I mean, imagine your greatest goal, whatever it
      is -- making a ton of money, winning an Academy Award, running a great organization, being
      great at a sport. Now imagine instantaneously achieving it. You'd be happy at first, but not
      for long. You would soon find yourself needing something else to struggle for."
  * My life as a game
    * "I have found it helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in which each problem I face
      is a puzzle I need to solve. By solving the puzzle, I get a gem in the form of a principle
      that helps me avoid the same sort of problem in the future. Collecting these gems continually
      improves my decision making, so I am able to ascend to higher and higher levels of play in
      which the game gets harder and the stakes become even greater."
  * Pain + Reflection = Progress
    * "Though this process of pushing your limits, of sometimes failing and sometimes breaking
      through -- and deriving benefits from both your failures and your successes -- is not for
      everyone, if it is for you, it can be so thrilling that it becomes addictive. Life will
      inevitably bring you such moments, and it'll be up to you to decide whether you want to go
      back for more."
  * Weigh second and third-order consequences
    * Nature sorts people by those who respond to first order consequences (they will fail) vs.
      those who respond to second order (they will succeed)
      * "Quite often the first-order consequences are the temptations that cost us what we really
        want, and sometimes they are the barriers that stand in our way. It's almost as though
        nature sorts us by throwing us trick choices that have both types of consequences and
        penalizing those who make their decisions on the basis of the first-order consequences
        alone."
    * Examples
      * Exercise: pain is the 1st order; health and attractiveness are the second.
      * Rich food: good taste is the first order; lethargy and weight gain are the second.
  * Radical open-mindedness requires you to replace your attachment to always being right with the
    joy of learning what's true.
    * Instead, learn to take joy in obtaining the best data for your decisions.
  * "Ask yourself: am I seeing this just through my own eyes? If so, then you should know that
    you're terribly handicapped."
    * The best answer to a problem can rarely be entirely produced by you. Gather inputs so you can
      cover every angle.
  * "If you had asked me what my objective was when I started out, I would've said it was to have
    fun working with people I like. Work was a game I played with passion and I wanted to have a
    blast playing it with people I enjoyed and respected."
  * Be radically open-minded
    * Closed-minded people focus much more on being understood than on understanding others.
      Open-minded people feel compelled to see things through others' eyes.
    * Closed-minded people are more likely to make statements than ask questions.
  * Habits
    * "If you do just about anything frequently enough over time, you will form a habit that will
      control you. Good habits are those that get you to do what your 'upper-level you' wants, and
      bad habits are those that are controlled by your 'lower-level you' and stand in the way of
      getting what your 'upper-level you' wants. You can create a better set of habits if you
      understand how this part of your brain works. For example, you can develop a habit that will
      make you 'need' to work out at the gym."

* Intro
  * Principles: fundamental truths, grouped by life situation, so you can iterate on your strategy
    for those situations and get what you want.
  * We get principles through experience and parents. Religion and legal frameworks provide holistic
    packages of principles.
  * As a kid, "I got excited about visualizing things to go after". Then developed principles in
    response to failure.
  * "I believe that the key to success lies in knowing how much to both strive for a lot and fail
    well."
  * "Experience taught me how invaluable it is to reflect on and write down my decision-making
    criteria whenever I made a decision, so I got in the habit of doing that. With time, my
    collection of principles became like a collection of recipes for decision making."
    * Eventually I could express my decision-making criteria as algorithms to embed in computers.
  * Part I: where I'm coming from
    * "Over the course of our lives, we make millions and millions of decisions that are essentially
      bets, some large and some small."
    * You are naturally gifted with intelligence, but decision making abilities (i.e. wisdom) must
      be acquired through "encounters with reality."
* My call to adventure (chap 1, 2, 3)
  * Grew up in the 1960s, which was an era of great ambition. Inspirational. Kennedy's space race.
  * Learned how to be "radically open-minded" so he could gather high-quality disagreement and
    convince himself of the best idea.
    * "I sought out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their
      reasoning."
    * "This experience led me to build Bridgewater as an idea meritocracy -- not an autocracy in
      which I lead and others follow, and not a democracy in which everyone's vote is equal -- but a
      meritocracy that encourages thoughtful disagreements and explores and weighs people's opinions
      in proportion to their merits."
  * Pulling Bridgewater out of China after a year's experiment
    * "I don't regret my choice. I learned that if you work hard and creatively, you can have just
      about anything you want, but not everything you want. Maturity is the ability to reject good
      alternatives in order to pursue even better ones."
  * The joy and value of "seeing the world through someone else's eyes"
    * "I love seeing the world through other people's eyes... this is true whether they are rich or
      poor." (example of person in Papua New Guinea, and world economic leaders). "Encounters like
      these have taught me that human greatness and terribleness are not correlated with wealth or
      other conventional measures of success. I've also learned that judging people before really
      seeing things through their eyes stands in the way of understanding their circumstances -- and
      that isn't smart. I urge you to be curious enough to want to understand how the people who see
      things differently from you came to see them that way. You will find that interesting and
      invaluable, and the richer perspective you gain will help you decide what you should do."
  * "I believe that all organizations basically have two types of people: those who work to be part
    of a mission, and those who work for a paycheck. I wanted to surround myself with people who
    needed what I needed, which was to make sense of things for myself."
  * Theme: be skeptical of black and white dichotomies which may be false.
    * Should Bridgewater stay a boutique or become a big institution? "I felt about this
      fork-in-the-road choice the way I felt about most others -- that whether or not we could have
      our cake and eat it too was merely a test of our creativity and character. For example, I
      could envision ways in which technology would help us get the most out of people" (and not
      become bloated).
    * "I didn't like the alternative of not allowing ourselves to become all we could be."
  * "Another one of those"
    * "Whenever something new came along that required me to make a decision, I would reflect on my
      criteria for making that decision and write it down as a principle so people could make the
      connections between the situation, my principle for handling these situations, and my actions.
      More and more, we saw everything as 'another one of those' -- another of a certain type of
      situation like hiring, firing, determining compensation, dealing with dishonesty -- that had
      principles for handling them."
      * Making his decision making about how to run the business into a concrete algorithm, so it
        was transparent and repeatable. Just like their investment strategy: underlying each
        principle was an overarching philosophy, which was also written down.
  * Recordings of meetings where decisions were considered and taken were edited, and then used as
    boot camps for new hires.
  * Baseball cards
    * He created a card for everyone in the company with their "stats" for all to see. E.g. Myers
      Biggs data. "Overwhelmingly positive". Sounds ballsy. This allowed the team to achieve better
      skill-task alignment.
  * He struggled to help his bipolar son, who made it out OK.
    * "That journey through hell gave me a much deeper understanding of how and why we see things
      differently. I learned that much of how we think is physiological and can be changed."
  * In 2008 he had two full time jobs: managing investments, and managing the business. He
    calculated that it would take 165 hours to do each well, and so he couldn't have one person fill
    both rolls.
    * "To me, the greatest success you can have as the person in charge is to orchestrate others to
      do things well without you. A step below that is doing things well yourself."
  * "Suck the marrow out of life"
    * At 60, he wanted to set up Bridgewater to run without him. He wanted to remain head of the
      investment arm, hand operational control over to someone else, and pursue his hobbies and
      family and friends. He wanted to "suck the marrow out of life."
* Returning the boon (chap 6)
  * The third phase of life
    * "In the third and last phase of life, when others no longer depend on us and we no longer have
      to work, we are free to savor life."
      * Would moving from phase 2 to 3 make me happy, or sorrowful?
      * His framing of "work as a game" makes it possible to still enjoy and be amazing at work
        until you die. The difference in phase 3 is you want to afford yourself the luxury of
        getting out of the critical path and not be essential, because this affords you greater
        latitude in your pursuits.
    * "I wasn't going to stop playing the markets, because that's a game I've loved playing since I
      was twelve and I will keep playing until I die. But I didn't want to be *needed* in either
      role, because of the key-man risk that would create for the company."
      * I wonder if "chairman of the board" or some role that's interesting but less on the critical
        path than CEO is a better role for one's happiness. Wouldn't Musk want to be Chief Inventor
        of Tesla rather than CEO?
    * "As I write these words in 2017, I view this year as the final one in my transition from the
      second phase of my life to the third, when I will have finished passing along the knowledge I
      have gathered along the way, and, as Joseph Campbell described it, I will be free to live and
      free to die. But right now I'm not thinking about the dying part; I'm thinking about how to
      live freely, and I'm excited about it."
  * Systematizing our idea meritocracy
    * The vision: have good data on people's merits, and a playbook for management scenarios which
      could take that data and produce good management decisions which matched merit to
      responsibility.
    * "It is now clear to me that the main difference behind why the investment management part of
      Bridgewater is likely to continue to do well and most of the other parts of Bridgewater are
      unlikely to do as well (if we don't change how we are operating) is that the decision-making
      processes for investment management have been so systemized that it's hard for people to screw
      them up (because they are largely following the systems' instructions) while the other areas
      of Bridgewater are much more dependent on the quality of the people and their decision
      making."
  * Anticipating the European debt crisis
    * He saw it coming, explained it painstakingly to policy makers, recommended counter measures,
      and the worst was avoided. Published a video to make this kind of education easier.
    * "I came to respect most of the policymakers I worked with and to feel sorry for them because
      of the terrible positions they were in. Most are highly principled people who are forced to
      operate in unprincipled environments."
    * Policy makers must maximize their country's well being, or even more narrowly, their
      constituents' well being, and this prevents them from cooperating over long time frames or
      seeing the full picture and optimizing that.
  * At this point in his life he's realized that he needs to pay it forward. "You can't take it with
    you when you die."
  * The hero's journey
    * Call to adventure
    * Crossing the threshold
    * The road of trials
    * Abyss
    * Metamorphosis
    * The ultimate boon
    * Returning the boon
  * Wrestling with the questions of philanthropy
    * "Imagine being faced with the choice between a big night out on the town or saving a child's
      life. That was essentially the choice we constantly faced."
    * "We wanted to do our philanthropy together, as a family activity, which has proven to be
      fabulous."
    * Questions one must answer:
      * How much money to give to your kids, such that they have little enough that they can learn
        to struggle and become strong from it?
      * How many of your generations should you budget to protect?
    * "While we have felt compelled to help, we've discovered it is very difficult to have a
      significant impact relative to the size of the problem."
      * E.g. how to sustainably help 10k disadvantaged kids convert into positive contributors to
        society?
    * "Giving away the money that I acquired during my lifetime -- and doing that well -- has been a
      joy, a challenge, and the appropriate thing to do at this stage in my life."
* Looking back from a higher level (Chap 8)
  * Over his life, he learned to "love his struggles" because each was an important opportunity to
    grow and develop timeless principles.
    * "In time, I realized that the satisfaction of success doesn't come from achieving your goals,
      but from struggling well. To understand what I mean, imagine your greatest goal, whatever it
      is -- making a ton of money, winning an Academy Award, running a great organization, being
      great at a sport. Now imagine instantaneously achieving it. You'd be happy at first, but not
      for long. You would soon find yourself needing something else to struggle for."
  * "I cannot say that having an intense life filled with accomplishments is better than having a
    relaxed life filled with savoring. I can say that being strong is better than being weak, and
    that struggling gives one strength."
    * "Being well-known is probably worse than being anonymous, all things considered."
    * The burden of being famous and having resources is immense.
* Embrace reality and deal with it (Chap 9)
  * My life as a game
    * "I have found it helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in which each problem I face
      is a puzzle I need to solve. By solving the puzzle, I get a gem in the form of a principle
      that helps me avoid the same sort of problem in the future. Collecting these gems continually
      improves my decision making, so I am able to ascend to higher and higher levels of play in
      which the game gets harder and the stakes become even greater."
  * Be a hyper-realist
    * "Reality is beautiful", so he appreciates the beauty of even harsh situations and all of the
      cause-and-effect relationships which drive them.
    * Dreams + Reality + Determination = A Successful Life
  * Truth -- an accurate understanding of reality -- is the essential foundation for any good
    outcome
  * Be radically open-minded and radically transparent
    * Be unbiased towards reality, so there is no obstruction preventing you from learning from it.
    * Don't feel guarded with how you feel and what you think of reality. It will cause
      misunderstandings and is inefficient.
  * Look to nature to learn how reality really works
    * "Most people are like ants, focusing on themselves and their own ant hill."
    * "While mankind is very intelligent in relation to other species, we have the intelligence of
      moss growing on a rock compared to nature as a whole. We are incapable of designing and
      building a mosquito, let alone all the species and most of the other things in the universe.
      So I start from the premise that nature is smarter than I am and try to let nature teach me
      how reality works."
    * He's looked to nature and the common themes of all animals to put the human struggle into
      perspective.
    * (He has an evolutionary worldview)
  * "Don't get hung up on your views of how things "should" be because you will miss out on learning
    how they really are."
  * "Evolving is life's greatest accomplishment and its greatest reward"
    * Striving is its own goal and reward.
    * Reality is optimizing for the whole -- not for you
      * What's best for the world is what's rewarded, and what will happen. Inventions that benefit
        the masses are rewarded. People die to make way for the young.
    * It is a fundamental law of nature that in order to gain strength one has to push one's limits,
      which is painful.
  * Pain + Reflection = Progress
    * "If you can develop a reflexive reaction to psychic pain that causes you to reflect on it
      rather than avoid it, it will lead to your rapid learning/evolving."
      * This is the ultimate habit: reacting to pain to make it into a growth opportunity, so that
        you can grow from challenges and losses
      * "Though this process of pushing your limits, of sometimes failing and sometimes breaking
        through -- and deriving benefits from both your failures and your successes -- is not for
        everyone, if it is for you, it can be so thrilling that it becomes addictive. Life will
        inevitably bring you such moments, and it'll be up to you to decide whether you want to go
        back for more."
    * Go to the pain rather than avoid it
    * Embrace tough love
      * Helping those he cares for to "struggle well"
      * "I will often deny them what they 'want' because that will give them the opportunity to
        struggle so that they can develop the strength to get what they want on their own."
      * "This can be difficult for people emotionally, even if they understand intellectually that
        having difficulties is the exercise they need to grow strong and that just giving them what
        they want will weaken them and ultimately lead to them needing more help."
    * Even huge, permanent setbacks can be fuel for growth and happiness, because striving against
      the setback and making gains is rewarding. The setback becomes a tool for you; an aid to your
      striving.
      * "The quality of your life will depend on the choices you make at those painful moments."
  * Weigh second and third-order consequences
    * Examples
      * Exercise: pain is the first order; health and attractiveness are the second.
      * Rich food: good taste is the first order; lethargy and weight gain are the second.
    * "Nature" poses trick questions for the important matters. Many consistently fail. Those who
      can focus on the second order will hit their goals and succeed.
    * "Don't let pain stand in the way of your progress."
      * Instead, understand how to manage pain to produce progress.
    * Nature sorts people by those who respond to first order consequences (they will fail) vs.
      those who respond to second order (they will succeed)
      * "Quite often the first-order consequences are the temptations that cost us what we really
        want, and sometimes they are the barriers that stand in our way. It's almost as though
        nature sorts us by throwing us trick choices that have both types of consequences and
        penalizing those who make their decisions on the basis of the first-order consequences
        alone."
  * Look at the machine from the highest level
    * Distinguish between you as the designer of your machine and you as a worker with your machine
      * "To be successful, the "designer/manager you" has to be objective about what the "worker
        you" is really like, not believing in him more than he deserves, or putting him in jobs he
        shouldn't be in."
    * Think of yourself as a set of machines and you have the ability to alter your machines to
      produce better outcomes.
    * Successful people can go above themselves to see things objectively and manage those things to
      shape change
      * Get outside of yourself, out of your own head with your own biases.
      * "Watching people struggle and having others watch you struggle can elicit all kinds of
        ego-driven emotions such as sympathy, pity, embarrassment, anger, or defensiveness. You need
        to get over all that and stop seeing struggling as something negative."
      * You are not the best at everything. Sometimes you should hand over a responsibility in your
        life to someone else and trust them.
      * "Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is a great skill that
        you should develop no matter what, as it will help you develop guardrails that will prevent
        you from doing what you shouldn't be doing." (I haven't been great at this).
* Use the 5-step process to get what you want out of life (chap 19)
  * Have clear goals
    * While you can have virtually anything you want, you can't have everything you want.
    * "Life is like a giant smorgasbord with more delicious alternatives than you can ever hope to
      taste."
    * Desires are typically first-order consequences. Don't confuse goals with desires.
    * Never rule out a goal because you think it's unattainable. Very few are completely
      unattainable. They get unlocked with more knowledge.
    * Remember that great expectations create great capabilities. Larger gaps produce better
      solutions.
  * Identify and don't tolerate problems
    * "View painful problems as potential improvements that are screaming at you."
    * Each problem you face is an opportunity. The painful ones are the greatest opportunities.
    * Don't avoid confronting problems because they are rooted in harsh realities that are
      unpleasant to look at.
      * I think he's advising to weed out the emotion of shame if it's preventing you from
        overcoming your pride, acknowledging poor performance, and troubleshooting.
    * "Once you identify a problem, don't tolerate it. You need to develop a fierce intolerance of
      badness of any kind, regardless of its severity."
      * Well said. This is the emotion that's triggered in me when I see bugs, see our system fall
        down, or a debugging workflow is harder than it should be.
      * I could use this framing a lot more in my life. "Why don't I have an efficient go-to healthy
        snack? I've gone long enough without it."
  * Diagnose problems to get at their root causes
    * Problem-solvers jump right to solution brainstorming once a problem is identified. Instead,
      diagnose/analyze it for 15m. Flesh out the picture of the problem, so you can see the root
      causes and become equipped to think strategically.
  * Design a plan that will get you around the problems
    * Think about your problem as a set of outcomes produced by a machine.
      * This distances yourself from the performance you currently have, and helps reveal how to
        close the gaps. Be objective and dispassionate.
    * "Movie script model": think of your plan as being like a movie script in that you visualize
      who will do what through time.
      * Start with coarse goals; layer in granularity, then plot all of the actions over time.
  * Push through to completion
    * Do what's necessary to push these designs through to results
  * Weakness doesn't matter if you find solutions
    * Everyone has at least one big thing that stands in their way of success. Each person typically
      fails at one particular step in this five step process more often than the others. Which part
      are you the most weak?
    * "Humility can be even more valuable than having good mental maps if it leads you to see out
      better answers than you could come up with on your own. Having both open-mindedness and good
      mental maps is most powerful of all."
    * On a grid of "what you know" vs. "humble & open-minded", you want to be in the upper right.
* Be radically open-minded (chap 20)
  * Have humility.
  * Optimize through data collection. That will build your confidence in your decision making, and
    yield better decisions.
  * Recognize your two barriers: your ego and your blind spots.
    * The lower brain exerts desires and emotions which are hidden from the prefrontal cortex, and
      thus hard to correct or control.
  * Radical open-mindedness requires you to replace your attachment to always being right with the
    joy of learning what's true.
    * Instead, learn to take joy in obtaining the best data for your decisions.
  * The ability to perform well when you don't have the knowledge is more important than having tons
    of knowledge.
    * "Sincerely believe that you might not know the best possible path and recognize that your
      ability to deal well with 'not knowing' is more important than whatever it is you do know."
  * Open-mindedness requires true, non-judgmental empathy.
  * "Ask yourself: am I seeing this just through my own eyes? If so, then you should know that
    you're terribly handicapped."
    * The best answer to a problem can rarely be entirely produced by you. Gather inputs so you can
      cover every angle.
  * Appreciate the art of thoughtful disagreement
    * Where both people step outside themselves and explore the other's view, to ensure they are not
      wrong. The goal is not conflict, or to persuade, and you must learn to do this so others don't
      feel like it's a conflict.
    * "In thoughtful disagreement, your goal is not to convince the other party that you are right
      -- it is to find out which view is true and decide what to do about it. In thoughtful
      disagreement, both parties are motivated by the genuine fear of missing important
      perspectives."
    * "To me, it's pointless when people get angry with each other when they disagree because most
      disagreements aren't threats as much as opportunities for learning. People who change their
      minds because they learned something are the winners, whereas those who stubbornly refuse to
      learn are the losers."
    * Dalio prefers to ask questions in this type of dialogue, rather than make statements.
  * Triangulate your view with believable people who are willing to disagree
  * Recognize the signs of closed-mindedness and open-mindedness that you should watch out for
    * Closed-minded people block others from speaking. If it seems like someone isn't leaving space
      for the other person in a conversation, it's possible they are blocking. To get around
      blocking, enforce the "two minute rule": each person can speak for at least two minutes before
      being interrupted.
    * Closed-minded people focus much more on being understood than on understanding others.
      Open-minded people feel compelled to see things through others' eyes.
    * Closed-minded people are more likely to make statements than ask questions.
    * A few good decision makers working effectively together can significantly outperform a good
      decision maker working alone.
* Understand that people are wired differently (chap 21)
  * We're wired differently -- that's the reality. So how do we take that into account when
    collaborating to find out what is true?
  * Self-interest vs. collective interest: "Wilson explains that man is perpetually suspended
    between the two extreme forces that created us: Individual selection which prompted sin, and
    group selection which promoted virtue."
  * Habitual behavior is driven by the basal ganglia.
    * "If you do just about anything frequently enough over time, you will form a habit that will
      control you. Good habits are those that get you to do what your 'upper-level you' wants, and
      bad habits are those that are controlled by your 'lower-level you' and stand in the way of
      getting what your 'upper-level you' wants. You can create a better set of habits if you
      understand how this part of your brain works. For example, you can develop a habit that will
      make you 'need' to work out at the gym."
  * "The most valuable habit I've acquired is using pain to trigger quality reflections. If you can
    acquire this habit yourself, you will learn what causes your pain and what you can do about it,
    and it will have an enormous impact on your effectiveness."
  * Thinking vs. feeling
    * "Some people make decisions based on logical analysis of objective facts... other people focus
      on harmony between people. They are better suited to roles that require lots of empathy,
      interpersonal contact, and relationship building, like HR and customer service."
    * Before they understood this at Bridgewater, conversations between Ts and Fs could be really
      frustrating. "Now we laugh as we bump up against our differences."
  * "Getting the right people in the right roles in support of your goal is the key to succeeding at
    whatever you choose to accomplish"
* Learn how to make decisions effectively (chap 22)
  * The biggest threat to good decision making is harmful emotions
  * Decision making is a two-step process: learning and then deciding
  * Synthesize the decision at hand
    * "One of the most important decisions you can make is who to ask questions of"
      * "Listening to uninformed people is worse than having no answers at all."
    * "New is overvalued relative to great. For example, when choosing which movie to watch or what
      book to read, are you drawn to proven classics or the newest big thing? In my opinion, it is
      smarter to choose the great over the new."
    * Don't over-generalize from too few data points.
  * Synthesize the situation through time
    * Focus on the right level of detail -- usually higher level than you think. Stay out of the
      weeds.
    * Be imprecise; embrace the phrase "by and large" to describe patterns.
      * Focusing on the details when doing macro analysis is the wrong approach.
      * People who volunteer exceptions which are unimportant distract the conversation. This wastes
        time.
    * Perfectionists spend too much time on little differences at the margins at the expense of the
      important things.
  * Navigate levels effectively
    * When making decisions, use the level appropriate for each decision. (Think of Google Map's
      zoom feature).
    * Use the terms "above the line" and "below the line" to establish which level a conversation is
      on
      * "An above-the-line conversation addresses the main points and a below-the-line conversation
        focuses on the sub-points. When a line of reasoning is jumbled and confusing, it's often
        because the speaker has gotten caught up in below-the-line details without connecting them
        back to the major points. An above-the-line discourse should progress in an orderly and
        accurate way to its conclusion, only going below the line when it's necessary to illustrate
        something about one of the major points."
  * Make your decisions as expected value calculations
    * Rather than favoring outcomes which are most probable. Many of us hate losses, even if the
      magnitude is small, but that's not correctly optimizing.
    * Raising the probability of being right is valuable no matter what your probability of being
      right already is.
      * Going from 80% confidence to 90% confidence halves the number of losses you will have. So
        gather more information to make you convert some of your losses into wins.
  * Prioritize by weighing the value of additional information against the cost of not deciding
    * "You need to constantly evaluate the marginal benefit of gathering more information against
      the marginal cost of waiting to decide."
  * Use principles
    * "Almost all 'cases at hand' are just 'another one of those', identifying which 'one of those'
      it is, and then applying well-thought-out principles for dealing with it. This will allow you
      to massively reduce the number of decisions you have to make."
    * "Make it a game to identify which pattern a new situation represents, and thus which
      principles should be brought to bear."
* Intro to work principles (chap 23)
  * Write out concrete values of what the org is about, and the rationale for each, before hiring
    others, and ensure they align with what the org stands for. It's how you can ensure the people
    will want to be together long-term.
  * Mental model of a machine operator
    * The operator looks down on the machine from a higher level, and repeatedly assesses whether
      the outcomes are consistent with the goals, and when not, tunes the machine.
    * The machine has two parts: culture and people.
  * "If you had asked me what my objective was when I started out, I would've said it was to have
    fun working with people I like. Work was a game I played with passion and I wanted to have a
    blast playing it with people I enjoyed and respected."
    * He considered his team as partners, not employees.
  * "The main test of a great partnership is not whether the partners eve disagree -- people in all
    healthy relationships disagree -- but whether they can bring their disagreements to the surface
    and get through them well. Having clear processes for resolving disagreements efficiently and
    clearly is essential for business partnerships, marriages, and all other forms of partnership."
  * "Bridgewater is the opposite of a cult: the way it works is to maximally encourage independent
    thinking."

* Trust in Radical Truth and Radical Transparency (chap 24)
  * "What most people like best is knowing there is no spin."
  * Example anecdote from Bridgewater: they told a department that management was investigating
    selling them to another firm, even when there was still tremendous uncertainty about the deal.
    * But people are generally terrible at keeping cool under uncertainty. How did they think this
      was a good idea?
    * Author says that this helped build and maintain trust with that department.
  * "For me, not telling people what's really going on so as to protect them from the worries of
    life is like letting your kids grow into adulthood believing in the )tooth Fairy or Santa Claus.
    While concealing the truth might make people happier in the short run, it won't make them
    smarter or more trusting in the long run. (it's a real asset that people know they can trust
    what we say. For that reason I believe that it's almost always better to shoot straight, even
    when you don't have all the answers or when there's bad news to convey. As Winston Churchill
    said, 'There is no worse course in leadership than to hold out false hopes soon to be swept
    away.' People need to face harsh and uncertain realities if they are going to learn how to deal
    with them -- and you'll learn a lot about the people around you by seeing how well they do."
    (sounds compelling).
  * Realize that you have nothing to fear from knowing the truth
    * The doctor's diagnosis will benefit you in the long run, because you'll be able to respond to
      it.
  * Have integrity and demand it from others
    * Avoid having a "duality" -- different inside from your outside.
    * "Aligning what you say with what you think and what you think with what you feel will make you
      much happier and much more successful. Thinking solely about what's accurate instead of how it
      is perceived pushes you to focus on the most important things." (yes, sounds more efficient)
    * Never say anything about someone that you wouldn't say to them directly and don't try people
      without accusing them to their faces.
  * Create an environment where "no one has the right to hold a critical opinion without speaking
    up"
    * "Don't judge people in your head without them getting to defend themselves."
    * Be extremely open. "It's simple: just don't filter."
  * Be radically transparent
    * Not totally transparent... but way more than most companies.
    * Use transparency to help enforce justice
      * He wants justice to prevail. If they violate a law, he believes the SEC should give
        Bridgewater what it deserves.
    * In considering the value of transparency, he's consistently evaluating the second and third
      order affects... which seem to be often even stronger long-term benefits than the first-order
      effects.
    * Make sure those who are given radical transparency recognize their responsibilities to handle
      it well and to weigh things intelligently.
      * People who are given the privilege of information need to know the boundaries around its
        use.
* Cultivate meaningful work and meaningful relationships (chap 25)
  * Is Bridgewater like a family, or a team? he says "like a family business." There's deep
    connection and support, but they will (lovingly) cut a member who's not performing.
  * "For example, we put into place a policy that we would pay for half of practically any
    activities that people want to do together up to a set cap (we now support more than a hundred
    clubs and athletic and common-interest groups)."
  * Be loyal to the common mission and not to anyone who is not operating consistently within it
  * Be crystal clear on what the deal is
    * Make sure people give more consideration to others than they demand for themselves
      * If you approach disagreements with this principle in mind, there will be much less emotional
        energy spend on "who is offending whom."
    * Make sure that people understand the difference between fairness and generosity
      * E.g. demanding a cash equivalent if you're not eligible for a perk.
      * "Generosity is good and entitlement is bad, and they can easily be confused, so be crystal
        clear on which is which."
    * Pay fairly. The compensation for work must be economically viable for both sides.
  * Recognize that the size of the organization can pose a threat to meaningful relationships
    * 50-100 still feels like a community, so carve up departments as needed to preserve that feel
      at some level of the org.
* Create a culture in which it is okay to make mistakes and unacceptable not to learn from them
  (chap 26)
  * Scenario: firing someone who had made a severe mistake would've encouraged the remaining
    employees to hide their mistakes.
  * At Blackstone they built a centralized "issue log" of mistakes made by traders, so everyone
    could learn from them and they could be systematically solved. (Sounds like eng post-mortems)
  * "Don't feel bad about your mistakes or those of others. Love them!"
    * Don't judge. Instead, feel good about the evolutionary process.
  * Don't worry about looking good -- worry about achieving your goals
    * Get over "blame" and "credit" and get on with "accurate" and "inaccurate"
  * "Remember to reflect when you experience pain"
    * Go towards the pain, live where it is. It's a precious resource; use it to learn and grow.
  * "Know that nobody can see themselves objective." So you need outside data to truly understand
    yourself when you're making mistakes.
* Get and stay in sync (alignment) (chap 27)
  * "Spend lavishly on the time and energy you devote to getting in sync, because it's the best
    investment you can make."
    * Is this true? Why is it that so often, it's super expensive to get alignment?
  * Watch out for "topic slip". Complete a topic before skipping forward to the next one.
  * Watch out for assertive "fast talkers"
    * This is a technique where the speaker makes assertions faster than they can be assessed. It
      doesn't allow for rigorous discourse.
    * "Recognize that it's your responsibility to make sense of things and don't move on until you
      do. If you're feeling pressured, say something like 'Sorry, but I'm going to need to slow you
      down so I can make sense of what you're saying.' Then ask your questions. All of them."
  * If you find you can't reconcile major differences -- especially in values -- consider whether
    the relationship is worth preserving.
* Believability weight your decision making (chap 28)
  * In short, query or put in a room three credible people who can help with an important decision,
    select them carefully, and focus on their reasoning, not their past conclusions.
  * "Remember that everyone has opinions and they are often bad. Opinions are easy to produce;
    everyone has plenty of them and most people are eager to share them -- even to fight for them.
    Unfortunately many are worthless or even harmful, including a lot of your own."
  * "Don't pay as much attention to people's conclusions as to the reasoning that led them to their
    conclusions. It is common for conversations to consist of people sharing their conclusions
    rather than exploring the reasoning that led to those conclusions. As a result, there is an
    overabundance of confidently expressed bad opinions."
    * The reasoning is probably timeless, whereas the conclusion is also a function of circumstance.
  * Selecting the right people to ask is half the work of getting to the truth.
    * "If you ask someone a question, they will probably give you an answer, so think through to
      whom you should address your questions."
  * Disagreeing must be done efficiently
    * The author recommends a brain trust of three people for most important decisions.
      * "Since you don't have the time to thoroughly examine everyone's thinking yourself, choose
        your believable people wisely."
* Recognize how to get beyond disagreements
  * "Make sure people don't confuse the right to complain, give advice, and openly debate with the
    right to make decisions"
    * Decision makers have specific responsibility and authority which they must bear. They are
      responsible for the result of the decision, so they must be the one to make it.
  * "Don't let the little things divide you when your agreement on the big things should bind you."
    * "Narcissism of small differences."
  * "Once a decision is made, everyone should get behind it even though individuals may still
    disagree"
    * "In order to be effective, all groups that work together have to operate with protocols that
      allow time for disagreements to be explored, but in which dissenting minority parties
      recognize that group cohesion supersedes their individual desires once they have been
      overruled."
