* Gems
  * Over his life, he's learned to love the struggles
    * "In time, I realized that the satisfaction of success doesn't come from achieving your goals, but from
      struggling well. To understand what I mean, imagine your greatest goal, whatever it is -- making a ton
      of money, winning an Academy Award, running a great organization, being great at a sport. Now imagine
      instantaneously achieving it. You'd be happy at first, but not for long. You would soon find yourself
      needing something else to struggle for."
  * My life as a game
    * "I have found it helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in which each problem I face is a
      puzzle I need to solve. By solving the puzzle, I get a gem in the form of a principle that helps me
      avoid the same sort of problem in the future. Collecting these gems continually improves my decision
      making, so I am able to ascend to higher and higher levels of play in which the game gets harder and the
      stakes become even greater."
  * Pain + Reflection = Progress
    * "Though this process of pushing your limits, of sometimes failing and sometimes breaking through --
      and deriving benefits from both your failures and your successes -- is not for everyone, if it is for
      you, it can be so thrilling that it becomes addictive. Life will inevitably bring you such moments, and
      it'll be up to you to decide whether you want to go back for more."
  * Weigh second and third-order consequences
    * Nature sorts people by those who respond to first order consequences (they will fail) vs. those who
      respond to second order (they will succeed)
      * "Quite often the first-order consequences are the temptations that cost us what we really want, and
        sometimes they are the barries that stand in our way. It's almost as though nature sorts us by
        throwing us trick choices that have both types of consequences and penalizing those who make their
        decisions on the basis of the first-order consequences alone."
    * Examples
      * Exercise: pain is the 1st order; health and attractiveness are the second.
      * Rich food: good taste is the first order; lethargy and weight gain are the second.

* Intro
  * Principles: fundamental truths, grouped by life situation, so you can iterate on your strategy for those
    situations and get what you want.
  * We get principles through experience, parents; religion and legal frameworks provide holistic packages of
    principles.
  * As a kid, "I got excited about visualizing things to go after". Then developed principles in response to
    failure.
  * "I believe that the key to success lies in knowing how much to both strive for a lot and fail well."
  * "Experience taught me how invaluable it is to reflect on and write down my decision-making criteria
    whenever I made a decision, so I got in the habit of doing that. With time, my collection of principles
    became like a collection of recipes for decision making."
    * Eventually I could express my decision-making criteria as algorithms to embed in computers.
  * Part I: where I'm coming from
    * "Over the course of our lives, we make millions and millions of decisions that are essentially bets,
      some large and some small."
    * You are naturally gifted with intelligence, but decision making abilities (i.e. wisdom) must be acquired
      through "encounters with reality."
* My call to adventure (chap 1, 2, 3)
  * Grew up in the 1960s, which was an era of great ambition. Inspirational. Kennedy's space race.
  * Learn how to be "radically open-minded" so he could gather high-quality disagreement and convince himself
    of the best idea.
    * "Seek out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their reasoning."
    * "this experience led me to build Bridgewater as an idea meritocracy -- not an autocracy in which I lead
      and others follow, and not a democracy in which everyone's vote is equal --but a meritocracy that
      encourages thoughtful disagreement sand explores and weighs people's opinions in proportion to their
      merits."
  * Pulling Bridgewater out of China after a year's experiment
    * "I don't regret my choice. I learned that if you work hard and creatively, you can have just about
      anything you want, but not everything you want. Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in
      order to pursue even better ones."
  * The joy and value of "seeing the world through someone else's eyes"
    * "I love seeing the world through other people's eyes... this is true whether they are rich or poor."
      (example of person in Papua New Guinea, and world economic leaders). "Encounters like these have taught
      that human greatness and terribleness are not correlated with wealth or other conventional measures of
      success. I've also learned that judging people before really seeing things through their eyes stands in
      the way of understanding their circumstances -- and that isn't smart. I urge you to be curious enough to
      want to understand how the people how see things differently from you came to see them that way. You
      will find that interesting and invaluable, and the richer perspective you gain will help you decide what
      you should do."
  * "I believe that all organization basically have two types of people: those who work to be part of a
    mission, and those who work for a paycheck. I wanted to surround myself with people who needed what I
    needed, which was to make sense of things for myself."
  * Theme: be skeptical of black and white dichotomies which may be false.
    * Stay a boutique or become a big institution? "I felt about this fork-in-the-road choice the way I felt
      about most others -- that whether or not we could have our cake and eat it too was merely a test of our
      creativity and character. For example, I could envision ways in which technology would help us get the
      most out of people" (and not become bloated).
    * "I didn't like the alternative of not allowing ourselves to become all we could be."
  * "Another one of those"
    * "Whenever something new came along that required me to make a decision, I would reflect on my criteria
      for making that decision and write it down as a principle so people could make the connections between
      the situation, my principle for handling these situations, and my actions. More and more, we saw
      everything as 'another one of those' -- another of a certain type of situation like hiring, firing,
      determining compensation, dealing with dishonesty -- that had principles for handling them."
      * Making his decision making about how to run the business into a concrete algorithm, so it was
        transparent and repeatable. Just like their investment strategy: underlying each principle was an
        overarching philosophy, which was also written down.
  * Recordings of meetings where decisions were considered and taken were edited, and then used as bootcamps
    for new hires.
  * Baseball cards
    * he created a card for everyone in the company with their "stats" for all to see. E.g. Myers Biggs data.
      "Overwhelmingly positive". Sounds ballsy. This allowed the team to achieve better skill-task alignment.
  * He struggled to help his bipolar son, who made it out OK.
    * "That journey through hell gave me a much deeper understanding of how and why we see things differently.
      I learned that much of how we think is physiological and can be changed."
  * In 2008 he had two full time jobs: managing investments, and managing the business. He calculated that it
    would take 165 hours to do each well, and so he couldn't have one person fill both rolls.
    * "To me, the greatest success you can have as the person in charge is to orchestrate others to do things
      well without you. A step below that is doing things well yourself."
  * "Suck the marrow out of life"
    * At 60, he wanted to set up Bridgewater to run without him. He wanted to remain head of the investment
      arm, hand operational control over to someone else, and pursue his hobbies and family and friends. He
      wanted to "suck the marrow out of life."
* Returning the boon (chap 6)
  * The third phase of life
    * "In the third and last phase of life, when others no longer depend on us and we no longer have to work,
      we are free to savor life."
      * Would moving from phase 2 to 3 make me happy, or bitter and sorrowful?
    * "I wasn't going to stop playing the markets, because that's a game I've loved playing since I was twelve
      and I will keep playing until I die. But I didn't want to be *needed* in either role, because of the
      key-man risk that would create for the company."
      * I wonder if "chairman of the board" or some role that's interesting but less on the critical path than
        CEO is a better role for one's happiness. Wouldn't Musk want to be Chief Inventor of Tesla rather than
        CEO?
    * "As I write these words in 2017, I view this year as the final one in my transition from the second
      phase of my life to the third, when I will have finished passing along the knowledge I have gathered
      along the way, and, as Joseph Campbell described it, I will be free to live and free to die. But right
      nwo I'm not thinking about the dying part; I'm thinking about how to live freely, and I'm excited about
      it."
  * Systematizing our idea meritocracy
    * The vision: have good data on people's merits, and a playbook for management scenarios which could take
      that data and produce good management decisions which matched merit to responsibility.
    * "It is now clear to me that the main difference behind why the investment management part of Bridgewater
      is likely to continue to do well and most of the other parts of Bridgewater are unlikely to do as well
      (if we don't change how we are operating) is that the decision-making processes for investment
      management have been so systemized that it's hard for people to screw them up(because they are largely
      following the systems' instructions) while the other areas of Bridgewater are much more dependent on the
      quality of the people and their decision making.
  * Anticipating the European debt crisis
    * He saw it coming, explained it painstakingly to policy makers, recommended counter measures, and the
      worst was avoided. Published a video to make this kind of education easier.
    * "I came to respect most of the policymakers I worked with and to feel sorry for them because of the
      terrible positions they were in. Most are highly principled people who are forced to operate in
      unprincipled environments."
    * Policy makers must maximize their country's well being, or even more narrowly, their constituents' well
      being, and this prevents them from cooperating over long time frames or seeing the full picture and
      optimizing that.
  * At this point in his life he's realized that he needs to pay it forward. "You can't take it with you when
    you die."
  * The hero's journey
    * Call to adventure
    * Crossing the threshold
    * The road of trials
    * Abyss
    * Metamorphosis
    * The ultimate boon
    * Returning the boon
  * Wrestling with the questions of philanthropy
    * "Imagine being faced with the choice between a big night out on the town or saving a child's life. That
      was essentially the choice we constantly faced."
    * "We wanted to do our philanthropy together, as a family activity, which has proven to be fabulous."
    * Questions one must answer:
      * How much money to give to your kids, such that they have little enough that they can learn to struggle
        and become strong from it?
      * How many of your generations should you budget to protect?
    * "While we have felt compelled to help, we've discovered it is very difficult to have a significant
      impact relative to the size of the problem."
      * E.g. how to sustainably help 10k disadvantaged kids convert into positive contributors to society?
    * "Giving away the money that I acquired during my lifetime -- and doing that well -- has been a joy, a
      challenge, and the appropriate thing to do at this stage in my life."
* Looking back from a higher level (Chap 8)
  * Over his life, he learned to "love his struggles" because each was an important opportunity to grow and
    develop timeless principles.
    * "In time, I realized that the satisfaction of success doesn't come from achieving your goals, but from
      struggling well. To understand what I mean, imagine your greatest goal, whatever it is -- making a ton
      of money, winning an Academy Award, running a great organization, being great at a sport. Now imagine
      instantaneously achieving it. You'd be happy at first, but not for long. You would soon find yourself
      needing something else to struggle for."
  * "I cannot say that having an intense life filled with accomplishments is better than having a relaxed life
    filled with savoring. I can say that being strong is better than being weak, and that struggling gives one
    strength."
    * "Being well-known is probably worse than being anonymous, all things considered."
    * The burden of being famous and having resources is immense.
* Embrace reality and deal with it (Chap 9)
  * My life as a game
    * "I have found it helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in which each problem I face is a
      puzzle I need to solve. By solving the puzzle, I get a gem in the form of a principle that helps me
      avoid the same sort of problem in the future. Collecting these gems continually improves my decision
      making, so I am able to ascend to higher and higher levels of play in which the game gets harder and the
      stakes become even greater."
  * Be a hyper-realist
    * "Reality is beautiful", so he appreciates the beauty of even harsh situations and all of the
      cause-and-effect relationships which drive them.
    * Dreams + Reality + Determination = A Successful Life
  * Truth -- an accurate understanding of reality -- is the essential foundation for any good outcome
  * Be radically open-minded and radically transparent
    * Be unbiased towards reality, so there is no obstruction preventing you from learning from it.
    * Don't feel guarded with how you feel and what you think of reality. It will cause misunderstandings and
      is inefficient.
  * Look to nature to learn how reality really works
    * "Most people are like ants, focusing on themselves and their own ant hill."
    * "While mankind is very intelligent in relation to other species, we have the intelligence of moss
      growing on a rock compared to nature as a whole. We are incapable of designing and building a mosquito,
      let alone all the species and most of the other things in the universe. So I start from the premise that
      nature is smarter than I am and try to let nature teach me how reality works."
    * He's looked to nature and the common themes of all animals to put the human struggle into perspective.
    * (He has an evolutionary worldview)
  * "Don't get hung up on your views of how things "should" be because you will miss out on learning how they
    really are."
  * "Evolving is life's greatest accomplishment and its greatest reward"
    * Striving is its own goal and reward.
    * Reality is optimizing for the whole -- not for you
      * What's best for the world is what's rewarded, and what will happen. Inventions that benefit the masses
        are rewarded. People die to make way for the young.
    * It is a fundamental law of nature that in order to gain strength one has to push one's limits, which is
      painful.
  * Pain + Reflection = Progress
    * "If you can develop a reflexive reaction to psychic pain that causes you to reflect on it rather than
      avoid it, it will lead to your rapid learning/evolving."
      * This is the ultimate habit: reacting to pain to make it into a growth opportunity, so that you can
        grow from challenges and losses
      * "Though this process of pushing your limits, of sometimes failing and sometimes breaking through --
        and deriving benefits from both your failures and your successes -- is not for everyone, if it is for
        you, it can be so thrilling that it becomes addictive. Life will inevitably bring you such moments,
        and it'll be up to you to decide whether you want to go back for more."
    * Go to the pain rather than avoid it
    * Embrace tough love
      * Helping those he cares for to "struggle well"
      * "I will often deny them what they 'want' because that will give them the opportunity to struggle so
        that they can develop the strength to get what they want on their own."
      * "This can be difficult for people emotionally, even if they understand intellectually that having
        difficulties is the exercise they need to grow strong and that just giving them what they want will
        weaken them and ultimately lead to them needing more help."
    * Even huge, permanent setbacks can be fuel for growth and happiness, because striving against the setback
      and making gains is rewarding. The setback becomes a tool for you; an aid to your striving.
      * "The quality of your life will depend on the choices you make at those painful moments."
  * Weigh second and third-order consequences
    * Examples
      * Exercise: pain is the 1st order; health and attractiveness are the second.
      * Rich food: good taste is the first order; lethargy and weight gain are the second.
    * "Nature" poses trick questions for the important matters. Many consistently fail. Those who can focus on
      the second order will hit their goals and succeed.
    * "Don't let pain stand in the way of your progress."
      * Instead, understand how to manage pain to produce progress.
    * Nature sorts people by those who respond to first order consequences (they will fail) vs. those who
      respond to second order (they will succeed)
      * "Quite often the first-order consequences are the temptations that cost us what we really want, and
        sometimes they are the barriers that stand in our way. It's almost as though nature sorts us by
        throwing us trick choices that have both types of consequences and penalizing those who make their
        decisions on the basis of the first-order consequences alone."
  * Look at the machine from the highest level
    * Distinguish between you as the designer of your machine and you as a worker with your machine
      * "To be successful, the "designer/manager you" has to be objective about what the "worker you" is really
        like, not believing in him more than he deserves, or putting him in jos he shouldn't be in."
    * Think of yourself as a set of machines and you have the ability to alter your machines to produce better
      outcomes
    * Successful people can go above themselves to see things objectively and manage those things to shape
      change
      * Get outside of yourself, out of your own head with your own biases.
      * "Watching people struggle and having others watch you struggle can elicit all kinds of ego-driven
        emotions such as sympathy, pity, embarrassment, anger, or defensiveness. You need to get over all that
        and stop seeing struggling as something negative."
      * You are not the best at everything. Sometimes you should hand over a responsibility in your life to
        someone else and trust them.
      * "Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is a great skill that you should
        develop no matter what, as it will help you develop guardrails that will prevent you from doing what
        you shouldn't be doing." (I haven't been great at this).
* Use the 5-step process to get what you want out of life (chap 19)
  * Have clear goals
    * While you can have virtually anything you want, you can't have everything you want.
    * "Life is like a giant smorgasbord with more delicious alternatives than you can ever hope to taste."
    * Desires are typically first-order consequences. Don't confuse goals with desires.
    * Never rule out a goal because you think it's unattainable. Very few are completely unattainable. They
      get unlocked with more knowledge.
    * Remember that great expectations create great capabilities. Larger gaps produce better solutions.
  * Identify and don't tolerate problems
    * "View painful problems as potential improvements that are screaming at you."
    * Each problem you fave is an opportunity. The painful ones are the greatest opportunities.
    * Don't avoid confronting problems because they are rooted in harsh realities that are unpleasant to look
      at.
      * I think he's advising to weed out the emotion of shame if it's preventing you from overcoming your
        pride, acknowledging poor performance, and troubleshooting.
    * "Once you identify a problem, don't tolerate it. You need to develop a fierce intolerance of badness of
      any kind, regardless of its severity."
      * Well said. This is the emotion that's triggered in me when I see bugs, see our system fall down, or a
        debugging workflow is harder than it should be.
      * I could use this framing a lot more in my life. "Why don't I have an efficient go-to healthy snack?
        I've gone long enough without it."
  * Diagnose problems to get at their root causes
    * Problem-solvers jump right to solution brainstorming once a problem is identified. Instead,
      diagnose/analyze it for 15m. Flesh out the picture of the problem, so you can see and eliminate the root
      causes and become equipped to think strategically.
  * Design a plan that will get you around the problems
    * Think about your problem as a set of outcomes produced by a machine.
      * This distances yourself from the performance you currently have, and helps reveal how to close the
        gaps. Be objective and dispassionate.
    * "Movie script model": think of your plan as being like a movie script in that you visualize who will do
      what through time.
      * Start with coarse goals; layer in granularity, then plot all of hte actions over time.
  * Push through to completion
    * Do what's necessary to push these designs through to results
  * Weakness doesn't matter if you find solutions
    * Everyone has at least one big thing tha tstands in their way of success. Each person typically fails at
      one particular step in this five step process more often than the others. Which part are you the most
      weak?
    * "Humility can be even more valuable than having good mental maps if it leads you to see out better
      answers than you could come up with on your own. Having both open-mindedness and goo dmental maps is
      most powerful of all."
    * On a grid fo "what you know" vs. "humble/open-minded", you want to be in the upper right.
* Be radically open-minded (chap 20)
  * Have humility.
  * Optimize through data collection. That will build your confidence in your decision making, and yield
    better decisions.
