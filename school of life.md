* Gems
  * Pessimism: a tool to improve satisfaction. The lower the expectations of relationships, sex, work,
    children, politics, the greater our satisfaction in the actual outcomes.
    * Self-esteem: (success / expectations).
  * A need to be alone
    * "At a certain point, we have had enough of conversations that take us away from our own thought
      processes, enough of external demands that stop us heeding our inner tremors, enough of the pressure for
      superficial cheerfulness that denies the legitimacy of our latent melancholy -- and enough of robust
      common sense that flattens our peculiarities and less well-charted ideas.
    * Retreating to be alone allows us to be our best selves when we return to fellow humans. Rested,
      processed, full of original opinions.

* Intro
  * Why don't we teach emotional education? It's believed to be unteachable, lying beyond reason, best left to
    instinct and intuition.
  * Religion provided emotional education throughout history. If you don't have that, where do you get it?
    "Culture".
  * Self-help is a widely discredited genre: garish covers, overblown promises. But this genre is working on
    core problems of self that we need to solve.
  * Once we stop growing physically, and when we plateau at work, we still grow emotionally as we age.
    Sometimes dramatically so.
    * "We may, over two sleepless nights, have entirely rethought our attitude to envy or come to an important
      insight about the way we behave when someone compliments us. We may have made a momentous step in
      self-forgiveness or resolved one of the riddles of a romantic relationship."
  * Art
    * Prior to romanticism, the point of art was to render tough or knotty lessons easier to absorb; to nudge
      our recalcitrant minds toward accepting ideas that we might nod along to but then ignore if they were
      not stated in especially varnished and graceful terms.
    * Ideas would have to be amplified by art in order to work their way properly into our muffled
      intelligence.
  * Ritual
    * To combat the frequent forgetting of important but difficult lessons.
    * Religious use of rituals: "it is they that have created occasions at which to tug our minds back to
      honoring the seasons, remembering the dead, looking inside ourselves, focusing on the passage of time,
      empathizing with strangers, forgiving transgressions, or apologizing for misdeeds. They have put dates
      in our diaries to take our minds back to our most sincere commitments."
    * "The best rituals don't so much impose upon us ideas that we are opposed to but take us back to ideas
      that we are in deep agreement with yet have allowed to lapse: they are an externally mandated route to
      inner authenticity.
  * First world problems
    * A fear of being too self-indulgent is counterproductive. "Part of what stops us addressing our emotional
      knots is a background belief that they are too small to be worth bothering with."
  * It's a devastating belief to think that it's possible to be completely an enduringly happy.
  * "What we can aim for, at best, is consolation -- a word tellingly lacking in glamour. To believe in
    consolation means giving up on cures; it means accepting that life is a hospice rather than a hospital,
    but one we'd like to render as comfortable, and interesting, and as kind as possible." (Yeesh. I reject
    this unambitious view.
  * Given the difficulty of life, and the presence of original sin, the best we can hope for is salves:
    understanding and companionship. We're not the only ones experiencing this type of pain.
  * In praise of melancholy
    * Melancholy is not rage or bitterness; it is a noble species of sadness that arises when we are properly
      open to the idea that suffering and disappointment are at the heart of human experience. It is not a
      disorder that needs to be cured; it is a tender-hearted, calm, dispassionate acknowledgment of how much
      agony we will inevitably have to travel through.
    * Contrast this with the unrelenting emphasis by society on buoyancy, joy, cheerfulness.
    * The melancholy know that many of the things we most want are in tragic conflict: to feel secure and yet
      to be free; to have money and yet not to have to be beholden to others; to be in close-knit communities
      and yet not to be stifled by the expectations and demands of society; to explore the world and yet to
      put down deep roots; to fulfill the demands of our appetites for food, sex, and sloth and yet stay thin,
      sober, faithful, and fit.
  * The simple vs the obscure
    * "In many areas of life, we observe a strange, unexpected phenomenon: a prejudice in favor of
      abstruseness, density, enigma, and the esoteric. Our respect for explanations that come close to
      incomprehensible, that provoke puzzlement, that employ uncommon words suggests an implicit belief that
      the truth should not come in a form that is easily fathomable. (yes, curious)
* Knowing the past (chap 2)
  * No one passes through childhood without incurring deep emotional "primal wounds." Our childhoods are so
    long. It's 20 years before we're classified as adults.
  * We are deeply shaped by our parents. Kids are impressionable during this period.
    * "We can return to our original home for a holiday when we are parents ourselves and find, despite our
      car, our responsibilities, and our lined faces, that we are eight once more."
    * When we are children, we are without a skin. If a parent shouts at us, the foundations of the earth
      tremble. We can't tell that some of the harsh words weren't perhaps entirely meant, or had their origins
      in a tricky day at work, or were the reverberations of the adult's own childhood. It simply fees as if
      an all-powerful, all-knowing giant has decided, for certain good reasons that we are to be annihilated."
  * As children, we can't understand that a parent is sometimes not in control of their own destiny. Why did
    they have to move away or travel for work?
  * The author argues that any perterbations in childhood cause personality imbalances; fears, sensitivities.
    Not dramatic, but significant. Is that really true? Aren't we giving too much credit to the environment?
    * "We make our lives tougher than they should be because we insist on thinking of people, ourselves and
      others, as inept and mean rather than, as is almost invariably the case, primarily the victims of what
      we have all in some ways traveled through: an immensely tricky early history." (This feels incomplete
      and flawed. Searching for that history in others is noble, empathetic, but should we really expect to
      attribute everything to it? No...)
  * Greek tragedies: from seemingly minor starting points, terrible consequences unfurl.
  * The emotionally helpful childhood
    * (Good, dense section).
    * Whole care from a powerful, generous adult: "They did not, all the while, ask that we thank them,
      understand them, or show them sympathy. They didn't demand that we inquire how their days went or how
      they were sleeping at night."
    * "Self-centeredness has to have a clear run in the early years if it isn't to haunt and ruin the later
      ones."
    * "in an emotionally healthy childhood, we're given the benefit of the doubt. We are assessed by what we
      might one day be, not by exactly what we are right now."
      * Charitable interpretations are frequently offered, along with connecting actions as followup.
    * "Boringly predictable": the relationship with our caregiver is steady, consistent, and long-term.
    * The adults know their own flaws and do not expect a child to be fundamentally better than they are. We
      do not have to comply at every turn to be tolerated. We can let others in on our shadow sides.
      * Some "moral freedom" -- opportunity to rebel.
    * Career isn't a rival. The adult gets their limelight elsewhere.
    * The good carer isn't overly ambitious on the child's behalf. They want them to do well, but for their
      own sake and in their own way. There is no particular script that the child has to follow in order to be
      loved.
    * In an emotionally healthy childhood, the child learns that things that break can be fixed. Plans can go
      awry, but new ones are made.
    * The child's life isn't manufactured to be perfect, without disappointment.
      * In contrast with bearable disappointment, the child is prompted to create their own internal world, in
        which they can dream, hatch fresh plans, and build up their own resources.
    * The child can see that the good carer isn't either entirely good or wholly bad and so isn't worth of
      either idealization or denigration. The child accepts the faults and virtues of the carer with
      melancholy maturity and gratitude -- and in doing so, by extension, becomes ready to accept that
      everyone they like will be a mixture of the positive and the negative.
      * Carer is a model of the population. Is this realistic, though? Our parents are often superheroes to
        us.
    * Asserts that parents aren't any better today at delivering this emotionally healthy childhood than we
      were for the last hundreds of years.
  * The markers of emotional love
    * Self-love
      * In relationships, do we have enough self-love to leave an abusive union?
    * Candor
      * Around others, how ready are we to learn? do we always need to take a criticism of one part of us as
        an attack on everything about us? How ready are we to listen when valuable lessons come in painful
        guises?
    * Communication
      * Can we have a plausible second go and take seriously the thought that others are not merely willfully
        misunderstanding us? Do we have the inner resources to teach rather than to insist?
    * Trust
      * "Of what material do we feel we are made?" (interesting prompt)
      * Do we, overall, feel the world to be wide, safe, and reasonable enough for us to have a legitimate
        shot at a measure of contentment, or must we settle, resentfully, for inauthenticity an
        misunderstanding?
* Therapy (chap 3)
  * (A treatise glorifying the use of therapy as an effective tool. Isn't this too rosy?)
  * Psychotherapy is a tool, like like a bucket to help you hold water, or a knife to cut.
  * In all of our relationships (friends, lover), we keep a barrier between what we say and what is really
    going on in our heads. No one else bears witness to our inner insanity. Except therapists. That's the one
    relationship we've constructed where it's OK to do so.
  * Therapists to require us to reciprocate rapport
    * "Like a parent who doesn't need a small child to reciprocate, the therapist voluntarily forgoes equality
      in the relationship; they wont' talk of their regrets or insist on their anecdotes. They simply want to
      help us find what is best for us, understood on our terms."
  * It's hard to focus. We keep losing the thread. We lose arguments and analysis about emotional subjects to
    the mental sands.
  * The therapists most powerful tools: "do say more", "go on."
  * Why is therapy spread out over so many months? It's because revealing ourselves and considering issues
    longitudinally is important for getting to solutions. We can't get to the bottom of things in a marathon
    session, without time between for our thoughts to marinate.
  * Building self-esteem: "when things don't go as we want, we can ask ourselves what a benevolent fair judge
    would say, and then actively rehearse to ourselves the words of consolation they would most likely have
    offered (we'll tend to know immediately).
  * Philosophical meditation: not the Eastern variety of achieving emptiness. Instead, focusing, examining,
    acknowledging our emotions around events.
  * Technique: turn over three questions
    * What am I anxious about right now?
    * What am I upset about right now?
      * We are almost invariably carrying around with us pulses of regret, loss, envy, vulnerability, and
        sorrow.
    * What am I ambitious and excited about right now?
      * To face our callings, and envision where they will take us, and how we'll be more fulfilled once we
        face those callings.
  * Warning against stoicism and relentlessly "manning up" when faced with trials
    * "We are mental athletes at shrugging such things off, but there is a cost to our stoicism. From small
      humiliations and slights, large blocks of resentment eventually form that render us unable to love or
      trust. What we call depression is in fact sadness and anger that have for too long not been paid the
      attention they deserve."
    * "We might, as we turn over our griefs, large and small, imagine that we are sharing them with an
      extremely kind, patient figure who gives us the chance to evoke hurt in detail, someone with whom there
      is no pressure to rush, be grown up or impressive.
  * "A daily period of philosophical meditation does not so much dissolve problems as create an occasion
    during which the mind can order and understand itself. Fears, resentments, and hopes become easier to
    name; we grow less scared of the contents of our own minds -- and less resentful, calmer, and clearer
    about our direction. We start, in flattering steps, to know ourselves slightly better."
  * The importance of a breakdown
    * "One of the great problems of human beings is that we're far too good at keeping going."
    * The big disruptions in "business as usual" shouldn't be censored and treated as scandalous. They're
      clear indicators that things must change, and death of the thing is preferable to the status quo.
* Kindness, meritocracies (chap 4)
  * Being a "generous onlooker", interpreter
    * Even when they do not know any of the details, generous onlookers must make a stab at picturing the
      overall structure of what might have happened to the wretched being before them. They must guess that
      there will be sorrow and regret beneath the furious rantings, or a sense of intolerable vulnerability
      behind the pomposity and snobbishness. They must intimate that early trauma and let-down must have
      formed the backdrop to later transgressions. They will remember that the person before them was once a
      baby too.
  * All of us can be richly generous in our interpretations, and in giving of sympathy. Unlike financial
    generosity, which is from rich to poor.
  * "Losers"
    * In short, beware the overly simplistic implications of a meritocracy.
    * "Our societies are very interested in winners, but don't really know what to do about losers --of which
      there are always, by definition, a far greater number."
    * In a meritocracy, "the status of a person has to be a more or less reliable indicator of their effort
      and decency."
  * In a meritocracy, failure is a catastrophe, because it sets your identity.
  * The ancient Greeks had a concept for this: the "tragic drama": you could be good and yet fail.
    * "These great fictional characters belonged to a far nobler, more dignified, and more humane category
      that tragedy helped to map: that of the tragic failure, the person who loses without thereby forfeiting
      the right to sympathy and mercy." These characters weren't losers; they inspire understanding.
  * The "weakness of strength": the theory that weakness-free people do not exist. Each person's weakness is
    the inevitable downside / shadow of one of their strengths. Comfort comes from not viewing a person's
    weaknesses in isolation, but as the necessary cost of enjoying the strengths that drew us to them.
    * E.g. messy but creative; driven but self-centered; uncompromising but honest.
    * "It's always an option to move away and find people who will have new kinds of strengths, but --as time
      will reveal -- they will also have new, fascinating, and associated kinds of weaknesses."
  * What to think about our enemies
    * Contented people have no need to hurt others. As a result, your enemies who hurt you must be unwell in
      some way.
    * Framing the victim as powerful: "We, who have no wish to hurt, are inf act the stronger party; we, who
      have no wish to diminish others, are truly powerful. We can move from helpless victims to imaginative
      witnesses of justice."
  * Politeness TODO(philc): delete
    * In modern times it's now associated with insincerity.
  * Frankness
    * The frank person spends time spent broadcasting signals of assurance and affirmation.
      * "The frank person assumes that everyone's ego is already at least as big as it should be. They are
        even likely to suspect that if you praise someone for the little things, you'll only inflate their
        self-regard to undue and dangerous proportions."
  * Diplomacy
    * "Knowing the intensity of the craving for respect, diplomats -- though they may not always be able to
      agree with others --take the trouble to show that they have bothered to see how things look through
      foreign eyes."
    * They work on the relationship just as hard as on the issue.
    * True kindness requires uncommon candor in moments
      * "True niceness does not mean seeming nice; it means helping the people we are going to disappoint to
        adjust as best they can to reality. By administering a sharp, clean blow, the diplomatic person kills
        off the torture of hope, accepting the frustration that is likely to come their way: the diplomat is
        kind enough to let themselves sometimes be the target of hate."
* Charm (chap 5)
  * Shyness
    * This is curable by focusing on the universal identity that we share with everyone. We are not an
      outcast, different, we have something to say and contribute.
    * Local identity vs universal identity
      * Our local identity comprises our age, gender, skin color, sexuality, social background, wealth,
        career, religion, personality type.
      * "Universal identity is made up of what we have in common with every other member of the species: we
        all have problematic families, have been disappointed, have been idiotic, have all loved, have all had
        problems around money, and anxieties -- and will all, when pricked, start to bleed."
      * Shylock's universal identity: "I am a jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hat not a Jew hands, organs,
        dimensions, sense, affections, passions? fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject
        to the same diseases, healed by the same means, armed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a
        Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?"
    * Shy people think they're boring: "when we dismiss a person as boring, we are merely pointing to someone
      who has not had the courage or concentration to tell us what it is like to be them. But we invariably
      prove compelling when we succeed in detailing some of what we crave, envy, regret, mourn, and dream."
    * The purpose of social intercourse
      * "The person we call interesting is in essence someone alive to what we all deeply want from social
        intercourse: an uncensored glimpse of what life looks like through the eyes of another person and
        reassurance that we are not entirely alone with all that feels most bewildering, peculiar, and
        frightening in us."
  * Vulnerability
    * Failure is what makes friends. Not winning. Hearing about the failure, what we're sad about, that we're
      lonely, how we're being embarrassed. It's endearing.
      * (But what about demonstrating strength? Vulnerability, without power, is warm but irrelevant).
    * By being vulnerable, you're offering up the valuable opportunity for others to hurt and humiliate you.
      * "Friendship is the dividend of gratitude that flows from an acknowledgment that one has offered
        something very valuable by talking."
  * Friendships
    * In short, be more friendly, and people will reciprocate.
    * Argues that people don't have well-defined thinking about whether they deeply like you as a friend. So
      you can deepen the friendship by showing that you like them.
      * "We have every opportunity to turn the situation in our direction. We can dare to persuade them to see
        us in a positive light, chiefly by showing a great deal of evidence that we see them in a positive
        light. We can apply the full range of techniques of charm: we can remember small things about them,
        display an interest in what they have been up to, laugh at their witty moments, and sympathize with
        them around their sorrows."
    * "Friendships cannot develop until one side takes a risk and shows they are ready to like even when
      there's as yet no evidence that they are liked back."
    * "We should stop worrying quite so much whether or not people like us, and make that far more interesting
      and socially useful move: concentrate on showing that we like them."
    * Warm person
      * "They do not equate friendliness with a relentlessly upbeat tone." They know it's OK to be sad and
        anxious sometimes.
      * "They don't want to flatter us in ways that could raise the cost of revealing anything more despairing
        or confused" about ourselves.
      * Contrast this to the cold voices "we so frequently hear in commercial contexts that ask us if we're
        having a great day today and that wish us a perfect afternoon in a city we've just touched down in."
  * Good listening
    * "We come to social life greedy to speak rather than listen, hungry to meet others but reluctant to hear
      them."
    * Good listeners help the speaker move from unconfused and agitated, to clear and serene.
      * "The good listener takes it for granted that they will encounter vagueness in the conversation of
        others. But they don't condemn, rush, or get impatient, because they see vagueness as a universal and
        highly significant trouble of the mind that it is the task of a true friend to help with."
      * (I struggle with this; when I see someone having trouble communicating through ambiguity that I don't
        myself have about the situation, I get impatient.)
    * "They don't, as most people do, interrupt to intrude their own ideas; they interrupt to help the other
      get back to their original, more sincere yet elusive concerns."
  * Social catastrophe
    * In recovering from severe faux pas, wonders whether we should just shut up and accept the failure,
      rather than profusely apologizing, justifying, or back-pedaling.
* Calm (chap 6)
  * Pessimism: a tool to improve satisfaction. The lower the expectations of relationships, sex, work,
    children, politics, the greater our satisfaction in the actual outcomes.
    * Self-esteem: (success / expectations).
  * A need to be alone
    * "At a certain point, we have had enough of conversations that take us away from our own thought
      processes, enough of external demands that stop us heeding our inner tremors, enough of the pressure for
      superficial cheerfulness that denies the legitimacy of our latent melancholy -- and enough of robust
      common sense that flattens our peculiarities and less well-charted ideas.
    * Retreating to be alone allows us to be our best selves when we return to fellow humans. Rested,
      processed, full of original opinions.
  * The importance of staring out the window
    * A period of purpose-free calm, where the birds in our mind, the ones that help constitute our identity,
      can land and be considered. Not celebrated in a productivity-obsessed culture.
  * Nature
    * Watching a sunset after a hectic work day
      * "At this moment, nature seems to be sending us a humbling message: the incidents of our lives are not
        terribly important. And yet, strangely, rather than being distressing, this sensation can be a source
        of immeasurable solace and calm."
    * The scene of a desert, where nothing changes day to day, and changes take centuries. Our lives come and
      go and mean little on such time scales.
    * "A central task of culture should be to remind us that the laws of nature apply to us as well as to
      trees, clouds, and cliff face.s Our goal is to get clearer about where our own tantalizingly powerful
      yet always limited agency stops: where we will be left with no option but to bow to forces infinitely
      greater than our own."
  * Acceptance
    * Pursuit of calm: aiming to be calmer this year than in years past. Accepting that there will be many
      periods where we are not calm.
