* Intro
  * Why don't we teach emotional education? It's believed to be unteachable, lying beyond reason, best left to
    instinct and intuition.
  * Religion provided emotional education throughout history. If you don't have that, where do you get it?
    "Culture".
  * Self-help is a widely discredited genre: garish covers, overblown promises. But this genre is working on
    core problems of self that we need to solve.
  * Once we stop growing physically, and when we plateau at work, we still grow emotionally as we age.
    Sometimes dramatically so.
    * "We may, over two sleepless nights, have entirely rethought our attitude to envy or come to an
      important insight about the way we behave when someone compliments us. We may have made a momentous step
      in self-forgiveness or resolved one of the riddles of a romantic relationship."
  * Art
    * Prior to romanticism, the point of art was to render tough or knotty lessons easier to absorb; to nudge
      our recalcitrant minds toward accepting ideas that we might nod along to but then ignore if they were
      not stated in especially varnished and graceful terms.
    * Ideas would have to be amplified by art in order to work their way properly into our muffled
      intelligence.
  * Ritual
    * To combat the frequent forgetting of important but difficult lessons.
    * Religious use of rituals: "it is they that have created occasions at which to tug our minds back to
      honoring the seasons, remembering the dead, looking inside ourselves, focusing on the passage of time,
      empathizing with strangers, forgiving transgressions, or apologizing for misdeeds. They have put dates
      in our diaries to take our minds back to our most sincere commitments."
    * "The best rituals don't so much impose upon us ideas that we are opposed to but take us back to ideas
      that we are in deep agreement with yet have allowed to lapse: they are an externally mandated route to
      inner authenticity.
  * First world problems
    * A fear of being too self-indulgent is counterproductive. "Part of what stops us addressing our emotional
      knots is a background belief that they are too small to be worth bothering with."
  * It's a devastating belief to think that it's possible to be completely an enduringly happy.
  * "What we can aim for, at best, is consolation -- a word tellingly lacking in glamour. To believe in
    consolation means giving up on cures; it means accepting that life is a hospice rather than a hospital,
    but one we'd like to render as comfortable, and interesting, and as kind as possible." (Yeesh. I reject
    this unambitious view.
  * Given the difficulty of life, and the presence of original sin, the best we can hope for is salves:
    understanding and companionship. We're not the only ones experiencing this type of pain.
  * In praise of melancholy
    * Melancholy is not rage or bitterness; it is a noble species of sadness that arises when we are properly
      open to the idea that suffering and disappointment are at the heart of human experience. It is not a
      disorder that needs to be cured; it is a tender-hearted, calm, dispassionate acknowledgment of how much
      agony we will inevitably have to travel through.
    * Contrast this with the unrelenting emphasis by society on buoyancy, joy, cheerfulness.
    * The melancholy know that many of the things we most want are in tragic conflict: to feel secure and yet
      to be free; to have money and yet not to have to be beholden to others; to be in close-knit communities
      and yet not to be stifled by the expectations and demands of society; to explore the world and yet to
      put down deep roots; to fulfill the demands of our appetites for food, sex, and sloth and yet stay thin,
      sober, faithful, and fit.
  * The simple vs the obscure
    * "In many areas of life, we observe a strange, unexpected phenomenon: a prejudice in favor of
      abstruseness, density, enigma, and the esoteric. Our respect for explanations that come close to
      incomprehensible, that provoke puzzlement, that employ uncommon words suggests an implicit belief that
      the truth should not come in a form that is easily fathomable. (yes, curious)
* Knowing the past (chap 2)
  * No one passes through childhood without incurring deep emotional "primal wounds." Our childhoods are so
    long. It's 20 years before we're classified as adults.
  * We are deeply shaped by our parents. Kids are impressionable during this period.
    * "We can return to our original home for a holiday when we are parents ourselves and find, despite our
      car, our responsibilities, and our lined faces, that we are eight once more."
    * When we are children, we are without a skin. If a parent shouts at us, the foundations of the earth
      tremble. We can't tell that some of the harsh words weren't perhaps entirely meant, or had their origins
      in a tricky day at work, or were the reverberations of the adult's own childhood. It simply fees as if
      an all-powerful, all-knowing giant has decided, for certain good reasons that we are to be annihilated."
  * As children, we can't understand that a parent is sometimes not in control of their own destiny. Why did
    they have to move away or travel for work?
  * The author argues that any perterbations in childhood cause personality imbalances; fears, sensitivities.
    Not dramatic, but significant. Is that really true? Aren't we giving too much credit to the environment?
    * "We make our lives tougher than they should be because we insist on thinking of people, ourselves and
      others, as inept and mean rather than, as is almost invariably the case, primarily the victims of what
      we have all in some ways traveled through: an immensely tricky early history." (This feels incomplete
      and flawed. Searching for that history in others is noble, empathetic, but should we really expect to
      attribute everything to it? No...)
  * Greek tragedies: from seemingly minor starting points, terrible consequences unfurl.
  * The emotionally helpful childhood
    * (Good, dense section).
    * Whole care from a powerful, generous adult: "They did not, all the while, ask that we thank them,
      understand them, or show them sympathy. They didn't demand that we inquire how their days went or how
      they were sleeping at night."
    * "Self-centeredness has to have a clear run in the early years if it isn't to haunt and ruin the later
      ones."
    * "in an emotionally healthy childhood, we're given the benefit of the doubt. We are assessed by what we
      might one day be, not by exactly what we are right now."
      * Charitable interpretations are frequently offered, along with connecting actions as followup.
    * "Boringly predictable": the relationship with our caregiver is steady, consistent, and long-term.
    * The adults know their own flaws and do not expect a child to be fundamentally better than they are. We
      do not have to comply at every turn to be tolerated. We can let others in on our shadow sides.
      * Some "moral freedom" -- opportunity to rebel.
    * Career isn't a rival. The adult gets their limelight elsewhere.
    * The good carer isn't overly ambitious on the child's behalf. They want them to do well, but for their
      own sake and in their own way. There is no particular script that the child has to follow in order to be
      loved.
    * In an emotionally healthy childhood, the child learns that things that break can be fixed. Plans can go
      awry, but new ones are made.
    * The child's life isn't manufactured to be perfect, without disappointment.
      * In contrast with bearable disappointment, the child is prompted to create their own internal world, in
        which they can dream, hatch fresh plans, and build up their own resources.
    * The child can see that the good carer isn't either entirely good or wholly bad and so isn't worth of
      either idealization or denigration. The child accepts the faults and virtues of the carer with
      melancholy maturity and gratitude -- and in doing so, by extension, becomes ready to accept that
      everyone they like will be a mixture of the positive and the negative.
      * Carer is a model of the population. Is this realistic, though? Our parents are often superheroes to
        us.
    * Asserts that parents aren't any better today at delivering this emotionally healthy childhood than we
      were for the last hundreds of years.
  * The markers of emotional love
    * Self-love
      * In relationships, do we have enough self-love to leave an abusive union?
    * Candor
      * Around others, how ready are we to learn? do we always need to take a criticism of one part of us as
        an attack on everything about us? How ready are we to listen when valuable lessons come in painful
        guises?
    * Communication
      * Can we have a plausible second go and take seriously the thought that others are not merely willfully
        misunderstanding us? Do we have the inner resources to teach rather than to insist?
    * Trust
      * "Of what material do we feel we are made?" (interesting prompt)
      * Do we, overall, feel the world to be wide, safe, and reasonable enough for us to have a legitimate
        shot at a measure of contentment, or must we settle, resentfully, for inauthenticity an
        misunderstanding?
