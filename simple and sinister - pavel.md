  * Mindset: "Don't work out; practice."
    * Strength, power, endurance are skills to be practiced, not worked out. "Set aside 30m each day, as you
      would to master a musical instrument."
    * "Your session is barely half an hour long; stay focused." No phone, TV, bathroom.
  * "Do swings faster than comfortable -- get-ups slower than comfortable." This is "hard style": it's the
    hardest form of these two exercises.
  * "Once you feel competent with the basic swing and get-up technique, here is the plan: it is simple as
    could be: just bang out 10 sets of each exercise daily, like brushing your teeth. All of your attention
    is on technique and power, and zero brain cells need to be involved in analyzing the workout and
    planning how to change it. What an opportunity to become an ultimate technician!"
  * Do exercise to store energy: think of these daily workouts as a recharge. Stop using the word "work
    out." You're practicing, and recharging your body's energy.
  * "The high road goes through building a strength reserve. Strength makes everything easier and you can make
    the five-minute goal weight feel light."
* Intro
  * The Russian Kettlebell: an extreme handheld gym. Well-rounded fitness.
  * In a nutshell, there are only two moving parts to this program: the swing and the get-up. No other
    exercises offer as many all-around benefits in such a tight package.
  * "A workout should give you more than it takes out of you." This workout leaves gas in the tank.
  * Treat a kettlebell as a loaded weapon. "A kettlebell will get your respect -- the easy way or the hard
    way."
  * "Train barefoot or wear shoes with a flat, thin sole and room for the toes to spread." Barefoot training
    allows for the application of more strength and balance.
  * Focus on quality, not quantity.
    * Once your form breaks down in a set due to fatigue, stop.
* The mindset
  * Don't work out; practice.
    * Strength, power, endurance are skills to be practiced, not worked out. "Set aside 30m each day, as you
      would to master a musical instrument."
    * Be fully absorbed in the task and committed to getting better than doing time and marking off a certain
      number of reps.
    * "There are no weight or rep goals to hit, only technical perfection. Evaluate your performance as one
      would in gymnastics, figure skating, or platform diving -- on skill and style alone."
    * Explore the movements, master the nuances.
  * Swings should be explosive: if you were to let go at the top, it should fly 6 feet. It's not a lazy
    pendulum movement.
  * Make the get-ups 30 seconds each. I believe this is a key to success that many people miss. They rush the
    get-up and therefore get a lot less time under tension and less quality movement. (and thus less benefit
    from the exercise).
  * "Your session is barely half an hour long; stay focused." No phone, TV, bathroom.
    * (Treat the warm up and cool down with the same "practice mindset" and focus. Get through every part
      quickly, smoothly, intentionally. Ask myself how tight am I through the warm ups, and how effectively
      did they loosen me up? How tight am I after the work out?
* Take the breaks off your strength
  * Lack of flexibility limits the range over which you can apply your strength.
  * Warm-ups (3x5 of each):
    * Prying goblet squat
    * Hip bridge
    * Halo (shoulders)
  * Prying goblet squat
    * Open yourself up with ramrod straight posture
    * Sit as deeply as you can without letting your elbows drop. Lean forward and back
  * Hip bridge
    * Put shoes or a pillow between your knees so they stay together and clinched. This forces your abs to
      activate, rater than relying on a hyper-extended back.
    * Go as high as you can for 5 seconds. Get maximal glute contraction.
  * Halo
    * Keep your shoulders down as much as you can.
    * Don't move the neck back and forth to dodge the kettlebell.
  * Cool down routine
    * 90/90 stretch
      * Looks kind of like a pigeon pose.
      * Athlean X says this is the best way to loosen the piriformis hip flexor.
      * Sit on left hip. Left leg is in front of you with the knee at 90 degree angle. Right leg is to your
        side, at a 90 degree angle.
      * Stretch by leaning forward to hinge the hips; don't round the spine.
    * QL straddle
      * Sit in a straddle position. Stretch your right arm overhead and get tall. Then lean and bring your
        right arm to touch your left foot.
    * "Nothing will happen in a single minute. The longer you stay in these two stretches and breathe through
      the tight spots, the better."
    * These stretches are targeting the portion of the hip that is heavily involved in swings and get ups.
* Swing
  * A swing is not a squat; a swing is a hip hinge. The knees should not be doing much work. The power comes
    from the hip movement.
  * When picking up a kettlebell, you never want your butt to travel up faster than your head. "Everything
    must travel as one piece, as in a jump."
  * "The more snugly your arms are pressed against your legs and torso, the more powerful the swings will be.
    You will literally be launching the bell with your body, as opposed to waiting for the power to be
    transmitted through the shoulders."
  * "If your technique is correct, the kettlebell will form an extension of the arms." The arms just transfer
    the power of the explosion from the hips. They're loose, like ropes.
  * "Do not try to swing it higher! Like a broad jump or a straight punch, the swing is an exercise in
    projecting power forward."
  * One armed swings are less balanced and recruit more muscle and stabilizers.
  * The hard style one-arm swing is an anti-rotation exercise. In other words, the weight is trying to twist
    you, while you insist on staying on a straight and narrow."
    * That said it's impossible to avoid some rotation, especially with a heavy bell.
  * Taking care of the hands
    * Use a little bit of chalk.
    * Hook the handle with your fingers, don't overgrip.
    * For swings, you can use thin cotton gardening gloves.
* The get up
  * "Exceptionally functional."
  * "The body is one piece."
  * "The get-up is a slow exercise and there is never an excuse to be out of position".
  * Walk between get up sets -- "do not lie around like a beached whale."
* The routine
  * "Bang out 10 sets of each exercise daily, like brushing your teeth."
    * "Once you feel competent with the basic swing and get-up technique, here is the plan: it is simple as
      could be: just bang out 10 sets of each exercise daily, like brushing your teeth. All of your attention
      is on technique and power, and zero brain cells need to be involved in analyzing the workout and
      planning how to change it. What an opportunity to become an ultimate technician!"
  * Warmup
    * Three circuits of mobility exercises: prying goblet squats, hip bridges, haloes.
    * "As an option, you may follow these with a couple of sets of get-ups with exaggerated slowness and
      precision with a shoe or a light kettlebell. Groove the movement. Instead of doing full get-ups, you may
      select a particular phase, say supine to elbow, and polish it. Take the movement apart and put it back
      together. This is not a warm-up, but a practice."
  * Every third workout, swing the same weight kettlebell, but with two hands instead of one, focusing on
    power and explosiveness. Two hands is easier, and is thus a form of active rest.
  * "Do not hesitate to switch to two-arm swings when you are dragging your tail -- and reap its many benefits
    while giving your mind a grip break."
  * "Do NOT do 10 reps left and 10 right back to back; set the kettlebell down and recover between the sides."
    Just like you would with a two-handed set -- take a break.
  * There are no time goals with the "Simple" part of the program, so forget about watching the clock.
  * Progression
    * "The type of progression where you up the load and then stay with it for a time is called step loading.
      It is very powerful and reliable."
    * Own a weight. Then, introduce a heavier weight (usually plus 8kg) 20 reps at a time, mixed in with the
      weight you've mastered. Every 4 weeks, increase the rep count of the heavier weight by 20.
    * Introduce the heavier weight into the third set. As you add more heavy sets, append them, working your
      way to the end. Then replace the first two sets.
  * Grip trouble: if you can't hold on to the heavier bells, split the set and take a 30s rest in between each
    half of the set.
  * It's fine to use smaller weight increments (4kg instead of 8). But then shorten the steps of weight
    increase from 4 weeks to 2 weeks.
  * "Muscles are given to a man not for admiration but for work."
  * "All weakness is a weakness of will." - Fridrich Nietzsche
  * Pacing
    * Argues that the benefit past 100 swings (in a day) is diminishing.
    * "Bulgarian elite gymnastics coach Ivan Ivanov believes that the purpose of a training session is to
      'store energy' in the body rather than exhaust it. That is a powerful mindset. In Ivanov's experience,
      100 repetitions per explosive movement hit the spot -- and these must be done daily."
      * Do exercise to store energy: think of these daily workouts as a recharge. Stop using the word "work
        out." You're practicing, and recharging your body's energy.
    * The talk test: it's a low-tech recovery timer. It ensures you have enough power to do a good set.
    * "My way of training the swing is looking at the volume and intensity and not worrying so much about the
      rest intervals. These will naturally diminish as work capacity and fitness improves."
    * Progressive loading: "Select a comfortably hard training load (weight, sets, reps, rest periods) and
      stay with it until it feels almost easy -- you own it. Only then move up." An advantage of this
      approach is that you never have to deload because you never overload.
    * Kettlebells have large jumps in weight and he argues that this is by design, and desirable.
      * "Sharp changes in load are superior to baby steps when it comes to delivering the message to your
        body: 'Get strong!'"
      * "An aggressive weight increase in the one-arm swing might present a problem with the grip, but it is
        easily solved with the rest/pause technique and rarely requires halving the amount of added weight."
      * If you can't increase by 8kg in the get up, increase by 4 kg.
* Sinister
  * With heavier weight, cut back to training only 3-4 times per week -- every other day.
  * Hard style training: "train explosively"
    * "Strength training authority Dr. Fred Hatfield pointed out that at least 75% of a conventional weight
      training set is wasted. Only certain parts of the lift are hard, and only the last reps. The rest is
      just semi-work and momentum. Hatfield instructed pushing as hard as possible against the weight every
      inch of the way and on every rep." E.g. applying more force to cause more acceleration on the swing.
  * Explosive fast swings, slow get ups. Those are the hardest versions of each exercise per rep.
    * "Do swings faster than comfortable -- get-ups slower than comfortable."
  * Stop your sets if your reps slow down. those ugly reps are not productive and are injury prone.
    * "If you can no longer pinch your cheeks, the gig is up. Ditto for your abs: failing to tense them at the
      top of the swing not only robs your power, but also endangers your spine."
  * Tool: speed run
    * Race the clock: do your 10 swings in five minutes. Uses glycolsis. Accelerates gains. Use infrequently,
      "as a side dish." Do once every 4 workouts, or once a week. Us a lighter kettlebell, one step down.
    * Then 1 minute rest, then 10 get-ups in 10 minutes, one weight down from the weight you "own".
    * "The high road goes through building a strength reserve. Strength makes everything easier and you can
      make the five-minute goal weight feel light. Pavel Macek recalls, '32 felt like 24 when my main training
      with was 40 -- I could do the 5m Simple test any time with 32."
* Summary
  * Simple:
    * Timeless
    * 100 one-arm swings in sets of 10: 32kg for men
    * Five get-ups per arm (sets of one) after the swings: 32kg for men
  * Sinister:
    * Timeless
    * 100 one-arm swings in sets of 10: 48kg for men
    * Five get-ups per arm (sets of one) after the swings: 48kg for men
  * Timed simple and timed sinister requires doing the swings in 5 minutes, and the get-ups in 10 minutes.
