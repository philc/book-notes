    * Strength, power, endurance are skills to be practiced, not worked out. "Set aside 30m each day, as you
      would to master a musical instrument."
* Intro
  * The Russuan Kettlebell: an extreme handheld gym. Well-rounded fitness.
  * In a nutshell, there are only two moving parts to this program: the swing and the get-up. No other
    exercises offer as many all-around benefits in such a tight package.
  * "A workout should give you more than it takes out of you." This workout leaves gas in the tank.
  * Treat a kettlebell as a loaded weapon. "A kettlebell will get your respect -- the easy way or the hard
    way."
  * "Train barefoot or wear shoes with a flat, thin sole and room for the toes to spread." Barefoot training
    allows for the application of more strength and balance.
  * Focus on quality, not quantity.
    * Once your form breaks down in a set due to fatigue, stop.
* The mindset
  * Don't work out; practice.
    * Strength, power, endurance are skills to be practiced, not worked out. "Set aside 30m each day, as you
      would to master a musical instrument."
    * Be fully absorbed in the task and committed to getting better than doing time and marking off a certain
      number of reps.
    * "There are no weight or rep goals to hit, only technical perfection. Evaluate your performance as one
      would in gymnastics, figure skating, or platform diving -- on skill and style alone."
    * Explore the movements, master the nuances.
  * Swings should be explosive: if you were to let go at the top, it should fly 6 feet. It's not a lazy
    pendulum movement.
  * Make the get-ups 30 seconds each. I believe this is a key to success that many people miss. They rush the
    get-up and therefore get a lot less time under tension and less quality movement. (and thus less benefit
    from the exercise).
  * "Your session is barely half an hour long; stay focused." No phone, TV, bathroom.
    * (Treat the warm up and cool down with the same "practice mindset" and focus. Get through every part
      quickly, smoothly, intentionally. Ask myself how tight am I through the warm ups, and how effectively
      did they loosen me up? How tight am I after the work out?
* Take the breaks off your strength
  * Lack of flexibility limits the range over which you can apply your strength.
  * Warm-ups (3x5 of each):
    * Prying goblet squat
    * Hip bridge
    * Halo (shoulders)
  * Prying goblet squat
    * Open yourself up with ramrod straight posture
    * Sit as deeply as you can without letting your elbows drop. Lean forward and back
  * Hip bridge
    * Put shoes or a pillow between your knees so they stay together and clinched. This forces your abs to
      activate, rater than relying on a hyper-extended back.
    * Go as high as you can for 5 seconds. Get maximal glute contraction.
  * Halo
    * Keep your shoulders down as much as you can.
    * Don't move the neck back and forth to dodge the kettlebell.
  * Cool down routine
    * 90/90 stretch
      * Looks kind of like a pigeon pose.
      * Athlean X says this is the best way to loosen the Piriformis hip flexor.
      * Sit on left hip. Left leg is in front of you with the knee at 90 degree angle. Right leg is to your
        side, at a 90 degree angle.
      * Stretch by leaning forward to hinge the hips; don't round the spine.
    * QL straddle
      * Sit in a straddle position. Stretch your right arm overhead and get tall. Then lean and bring your
        right arm to touch your left foot.
    * "Nothing will happen in a single minute. The longer you stay in these two stretches and breathe through
      the tight spots, the better."
    * These stretches are targeting the portion of the hip that is heavily involved in swings and get ups.
* Swing
  * A swing is not a squat; a swing is a hip hinge. The knees should not be doing much work. The power comes
    from the hip movement.
  * When picking up a kettlebell, you never want your butt to travel up faster than your head. "Everything
    must travel as one piece, as in a jump."
  * "The more snugly your arms are pressed against your legs and torso, the more powerful the swings will be.
    You will literally be launching the bell with your body, as opposed to waiting for the power to be
    transmitted through the shoulders."
  * "If your technique is correct, the kettlebell will form an extension of the arms." The arms just transfer
    the power of the explosion from the hips. They're loose, like ropes.
  * "Do not try to swing it higher! Like a broad jump or a straight punch,t he swing is an exercise in
    projecting power forward."
  * One armed swings are less balanced and recruit more muscle and stabilizers.
  * The hard style one-arm swing is an anti-rotation exercise. In other words, the weight is trying to twist
    you, while you insist on staying on a straight and narrow."
    * That said it's impossible to avoid some rotation, especially with a heavy bell.
  * Taking care of the hands
    * Use a little bit of chalk.
    * Hook the handle with your fingers, don't overgrip.
    * For swings, you can use thin cotton gardening gloves.
* The get up
  * "Exceptionally functional."
  * "The body is on piece."
  * "The get-up is a slow exercise and there is never an excuse to be out of position".
