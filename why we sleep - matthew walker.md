* To sleep (chap 1)
  * "Vehicular accidents caused by drowsy driving exceed thsoe caused by alcohol and drugs combined."
  * Sleep is clearly designed to be important. It is a bounty of ehalth benefits.
  * "Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day." It's
    yours for the taking.
* Caffeine, jet lag, and melatonin (chap 2)
  * Circadian rhythm, the "powerful sculpting force" around the day. It controls release of horrmones and your
    mood throughout the day.
  * When daylaightght is absent, the natural human circadian rhythm is 24.25 hours. For some mammals, it's
    less than 24hrs. The sunlight resets our imprecise internal clock.
  * "Whiel light is the most reliable and thus the primary zeitgeber (synchronizer), there are many factors
    that can be used in addition to, or in the absence of, daylight."
    * Even blind people have an accurate circadian rhythm.
  * The body's temperature fluctuates by 1/2 a degree throughout the day. The drop int emperature at night
    helps initiate sleep.
    * The body's temp fluctuates whether you actually sleep or not.
  * About circadian rhythms, "the respsective peak and trough points are strikingly different from one
    individual to the next."
  * "An adult's owlness or larkness, also known as their chronotype, is strongly determined by gnetics. If
    you are a night owl, it's likely that one (or both) of your parents is a night owl."
  * "Unfortunately, owls are more chronically sleep-depreived, having to wake up with the larks, but not being
    able to fall asleep until far later in the evening." Owls are thus often forced to burn the proverbial
    candle at both ends. Greater ill health caused by a lack of sleep therefore befalls owls, including higher
    rates of depression, anxiety, diabetes, cancer, heart attack, and stroke."
    * The owls are disadvantaged because the work place has standardized on the early lark schedule.
  * Melatonin
    * Melatonin is the hormone emitted by your brain to implement the circadian rhythm.
      * It ramps up at dusk and coordinates the timing of sleep to other brain regions.
    * Pace of jet lag adjustment
      * "It's a slow process. For every day you are in a different time zone, your suprachiasmatic nucleus can
        only readjust by about one hour. It therefore took me about eight days to readjust to London time after
        having been in San Francisco."
    * Traveling Westward is easier than eastward, because it's easier to stretch a day and stay up late than it
      is to shrink a day.
    * Flight crews do routinely make long haul flights. Disturbing.
      * "Parts of their brains -- specifically those related to learning an dmemory -- had physically shrunk,
        suggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of time-zone travel."
    * Take melatonin at 7pm in the new time zone to mimic the body's natural reaction to dusk, and signal that
      it will soon be time for sleep.
  * Adenosine is a hormone that builds up continuously and implements sleep pressure.
    * "Think of it as a chemical barometer that continuously regiseters the amount of elapsed time since you
      woke up this morning."
    * "High concentrations of adenosine simultaneously turn down the 'volume' of wake-promoting regions in the
      brain and turn up the dial on sleep-inducing regions."
    * Cafffeine mutes adenosine by occupying the neuroreceptors that adenosine targets.
    * Caffeine level peaks 30m after oral consumption. The half-life is six hours. Although genetics allow
      some people to have a more efficient enzyme which clears it in less than three hours.
    * Beware dark chocolate at night, because it contains caffeine.
    * Caffeine crash: the high contrast between complete wakefulness because of adenosine blockage, versus the
      high adenosine count once the caffeine wars off.
    * (Fun diagram of the effects of varoius drugs on spiderweb building. Caffeine produced the worst
      results).
  * Sleep pressure and circadian rhythm do not coordinate, but they are usually aligned.
  * "Sleep debt" comes from adenosine accumulation across nights, because the sleep each night wasn't long
    enough to clear all of the adenosine.
  * The target for a healthy sleep program is to wake up without the use of an alarm clock.
* Defining and generating sleep (chap 3)
  * During sleep, NREM (non-rapid eye movement) transitions to REM sleep every 90m.
  * The first half of the night is dominated by deep sleep, stages 3 and 4. The second half is by REM.
  * (The EKG spindles from brain activity in deep NREM sleep are incredible -- how can they be so slow and
    predictable / rhythmic? It's millions of brain cells somehow coordinating and firing in unison.)
  * The slow, synchronized waves of deep sleep are somehow transferring memroies from short to long term
    storage.
  * "REM sleep has also been called paradoxical sleep: a brain that appears awake, yet a body that is clearly
    asleep. It is often imposible to distinguish REM sleep from wakefulness using just electrical brainwave
    activity."
  * "Each and every night, REM sleep ushers you into a preposterous theater wherein you are treated to a
    bizarre, highly associative carnival of autobiographical themes."
  * "Mere seconds before the dreaming phase begins, and for as long as the REM-sleep period lasts, you are
    completely paralyzed. There is no tone in the voluntary muscles of your body. None whatsoever."
    * Your muscles maintain tone in NREM sleep.
