* To sleep (chap 1)
  * "Vehicular accidents caused by drowsy driving exceed those caused by alcohol and drugs combined."
  * Sleep is clearly designed to be important. It is a bounty of health benefits.
  * "Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day." It's
    yours for the taking.
* Caffeine, jet lag, and melatonin (chap 2)
  * Circadian rhythm, the "powerful sculpting force" around the day. It controls release of hormones and your
    mood throughout the day.
  * When daylight is absent, the natural human circadian rhythm is 24.25 hours. For some mammals, it's
    less than 24hrs. The sunlight resets our imprecise internal clock.
  * "While light is the most reliable and thus the primary zeitgeber (synchronizer), there are many factors
    that can be used in addition to, or in the absence of, daylight."
    * Even blind people have an accurate circadian rhythm.
  * The body's temperature fluctuates by 1/2 a degree throughout the day. The drop in temperature at night
    helps initiate sleep.
    * The body's temp fluctuates whether you actually sleep or not.
  * About circadian rhythms, "the respective peak and trough points are strikingly different from one
    individual to the next."
  * "An adult's owlness or larkness, also known as their chronotype, is strongly determined by genetics. If
    you are a night owl, it's likely that one (or both) of your parents is a night owl."
  * "Unfortunately, owls are more chronically sleep-deprived, having to wake up with the larks, but not being
    able to fall asleep until far later in the evening." Owls are thus often forced to burn the proverbial
    candle at both ends. Greater ill health caused by a lack of sleep therefore befalls owls, including higher
    rates of depression, anxiety, diabetes, cancer, heart attack, and stroke."
    * The owls are disadvantaged because the work place has standardized on the early lark schedule.
  * Melatonin
    * Melatonin is the hormone emitted by your brain to implement the circadian rhythm.
      * It ramps up at dusk and coordinates the timing of sleep to other brain regions.
    * Pace of jet lag adjustment
      * "It's a slow process. For every day you are in a different time zone, your suprachiasmatic nucleus can
        only readjust by about one hour. It therefore took me about eight days to readjust to London time
        after having been in San Francisco."
    * Traveling Westward is easier than eastward, because it's easier to stretch a day and stay up late than
      it is to shrink a day.
    * Flight crews do routinely make long haul flights. Disturbing.
      * "Parts of their brains -- specifically those related to learning and memory -- had physically shrunk,
        suggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of time-zone travel."
    * Take melatonin at 7pm in the new time zone to mimic the body's natural reaction to dusk, and signal that
      it will soon be time for sleep.
  * Adenosine is a hormone that builds up continuously and implements sleep pressure.
    * "Think of it as a chemical barometer that continuously registers the amount of elapsed time since you
      woke up this morning."
    * "High concentrations of adenosine simultaneously turn down the 'volume' of wake-promoting regions in the
      brain and turn up the dial on sleep-inducing regions."
    * Caffeine mutes adenosine by occupying the neuroreceptors that adenosine targets.
    * Caffeine level peaks 30m after oral consumption. The half-life is six hours. Although genetics allow
      some people to have a more efficient enzyme which clears it in less than three hours.
    * Beware dark chocolate at night, because it contains caffeine.
    * Caffeine crash: the high contrast between complete wakefulness because of adenosine blockage, versus the
      high adenosine count once the caffeine wars off.
    * (Fun diagram of the effects of various drugs on spiderweb building. Caffeine produced the worst
      results).
  * Sleep pressure and circadian rhythm do not coordinate, but they are usually aligned.
  * "Sleep debt" comes from adenosine accumulation across nights, because the sleep each night wasn't long
    enough to clear all of the adenosine.
  * The target for a healthy sleep program is to wake up without the use of an alarm clock.
* Defining and generating sleep (chap 3)
  * During sleep, NREM(non-rapid eye movement) transitions to REM sleep every 90m.
  * The first half of the night is dominated by deep sleep, stages 3 and 4. The second half is by REM.
  * (The EKG spindles from brain activity in deep NREM sleep are incredible -- how can they be so slow and
    predictable / rhythmic? It's millions of brain cells somehow coordinating and firing in unison.)
  * The slow, synchronized waves of deep sleep are somehow transferring memories from short to long term
    storage.
  * "REM sleep has also been called paradoxical sleep: a brain that appears awake, yet a body that is clearly
    asleep. It is often impossible to distinguish REM sleep from wakefulness using just electrical brainwave
    activity."
  * "Each and every night, REM sleep ushers you into a preposterous theater wherein you are treated to a
    bizarre, highly associative carnival of autobiographical themes."
  * "Mere seconds before the dreaming phase begins, and for as long as the REM-sleep period lasts, you are
    completely paralyzed. There is no tone in the voluntary muscles of your body. None whatsoever."
    * Your muscles maintain tone in NREM sleep.
* Ape beds, dinosaurs, and napping with half a brain (chap 4)
  * All animals studied have some form of sleep, where they are passive and unresponsive to external stimuli,
    and when deprived, they seek to recuperate it.
  * Dolphins sleep in one brain hemisphere at a time.
  * Birds that group together in a flock will from a line; the middle of the flock sleeps with both halves of
    their brain. The end guards will sleep with only 1/2 of their rains, keeping one eye open.
    * Amazing: "At some point, the two end-guards will stand up, rotate 180 degrees, and sit back down,
      allowing the other side of their respective brains to enter deep sleep."
  * REM sleep is never done on just 1/2 the brain, while the other half is awake.
  * Argues that pre-industrial age peoples had biphasic sleep -- 7hrs at night and 1/hr nap during high heat.
    And "midnight" was actually the middle of the night for them.
  * Everyone experiences "post-prandial (i.e. meal) alertness dip" -- the afternoon slump -- that pressures
    sleep. For this reason, don't schedule your presentation mid-afternoon.
  * "From a prescription written long ago in our ancestral genetic code, the practice of natural biphasic
    sleep, and a healthy diet, appear to be the keys to a long-sustained life."
    * Argues that there's a measurable, decreased risk of heart disease in enclaves of Greece where siestas
      still happen. Why do kids stop napping? Would they take a siesta if they had less stimulation?
  * (There's a lot of wishful evolutionary speculation in this chapter)
  * Argues that our intensity of sleep, i.e. the proportion of REM sleep, is what enables us to be intelligent
    and socially complex, when compared to other animals.
  * The power of REM sleep for our species, when it's used for emotional processing:
    * "We humans can instantiate vast numbers of emotions in our embodied brains, and thereafter, deeply
      experience and even regulate those emotions. Moreover, we can recognize and help shape the emotions of
      others. Through both of these intra- and interpersonal processes, we can forge the types of cooperative
      alliances that are necessary to establish large social groups, and beyond groups, entire societies
      brimming with powerful structures and ideologies. What may at first blush have seemed like a modest
      asset awarded by REM sleep to a single individual is, I believe, one of the most valuable commodities
      ensuring the survival and dominance of our species as a collective."
  * On the value of creativity vs. the value of social complexity
    * "Creativity is an evolutionary powerful tool, yes. But it is largely limited to an individual. Unless
      creative, ingenious solutions can be shared between individuals through the emotionally rich, pro-social
      bonds and cooperative relationships that REM sleep fosters -- then creativity is far more likely to
      remain fixed within an individual, rather than spread to the masses."
  * Summary of his view on the impact of sleep on human evolution: the breakout moment was learning to form
    large social groups.
    * "Our shift from tree to ground sleeping instigated an ever more bountiful amount of relative REM sleep
      compared with other primates, and from this bounty emerged a steep increase in cognitive creativity,
      emotional intelligence, and thus social complexity."
* Changes in sleep across the life span (chap 5)
  * Two weeks before birth, a baby doubles its consumption of REM sleep to 12 hours a day.
    * Possibly why: "The brain, like the roof of a house, is one of the last items to be constructed during
      development. And like a roof, there are sub-stages to that process -- you need a roof frame before you
      can start adding roof tiles."
    * "Dazzling bursts of electrical activity during REM sleep stimulate the lush growth of neural pathways."
  * On autism
    * "Imbalances in synaptic connections are common in autistic individuals: excess amounts of connectivity
      in some parts of the brain, deficiencies in others." There's less hardware for social engagement.
    * The brain's uneven development when they're young may have a root cause in their sleep drive
      * "Biologically, it is as if the day and night are far less light and dark, respectively, for autistic
        individuals. As a consequences, there is a weaker signal for when stable wake and solid sleep should
        take place. Additionally, and perhaps related, the total amount of sleep that autistic children can
        generate is less than that of non-autistic children."
      * Autistic children consume 30-50% less REM sleep than regular children.
      * Initial read on the direction of causality here: "rats deprived of REM sleep during infancy go on to
        become socially withdrawn and isolated as adolescents and adults."
  * Alcohol suppresses REM sleep. Mothers who drink, even a glass in the first two weeks, noticeably inhibit
    the REM sleep of hte fetus. Same is true when drinking while breast feeding.
  * Alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been linked to autism.
  * "What emerges from all of those studies is that REM sleep is not optional during early human life, but
    obligatory. Every hour of REM sleep appears to count, as evidenced by the desperate attempt by a fetu sor
    newborn to regain any REM sleep when it is lost."
  * At birth, the NREM/REM ratio beings at 50/540, and throughout childhood, slowly transitions to 80/20.
  * Argues that brain pathway expansion is the priority early in life, and is done via REM. Pruning pathways,
    for efficiency, becomes the priority at puberty, and is done through NREM.
  * Good analogy of an ISP using use-dependent shaping of the network
    * "A use-reshaping and downsizing must still occur if maximum network efficiency is to be achieved."
  * A tree analogy of a brain's maturation through life
    * "A tree as it first comes into bud in the spring (babyhood), then bursts into leaf during the summer
      (late childhood), then matures in color come the fall (early adolescence), and finally sheds its leave
      in the winter (late adolescence and early adulthood)."
  * "The ability to learn, retain, and thus remember new memories persists, even when set against the backdrop
    of general connectivity down-scaling throughout late development. Nevertheless, by teenage years, the
    brain is less malleable, or plastic, than during infancy or early childhood -- one example being the ease
    with which younger children can pick up a second language compared with older adolescents."
  * Children have a circadian rhythm that runs earlier than teens and adults, which prevents them from
    indulging in late nights.
  * Teens have later circadian rhythms than even adults, which makes early school start times tragic for their
    sleep health.
  * Older adults need as much sleep as always, but can't generate as much sleep drive as they age.
  * In your 40s, the deep NREM brainwaves are less deep and less powerful -- 60% less so than when we were
    teens.
  * Older adults have weakened bladders and thus more fragmented sleep, and less efficient time in bed. To
    mitigate this, drink less before bed.
  * In seniors, dozing off on the couch because you stayed up too late given the shifting circadian rhythm, is
    in fact a nap which reduces adenosine sleep pressure when you awake in your chair, decreasing sleep
    efficiency from then on.
  * If you want to shift your rhythm to later, get sunlight late in the day to promote melatonin and
    wakefulness, or take melatonin supplements.
  * "The parts of our brain that ignite healthy deep sleep at night are the very same areas that degenerate,
    or atrophy, earliest and most severely as we age."
* Your mother and Shakespeare knew (the benefits of sleep for the brain) (chap 6)
  * Sleep prior to learning primes the brain to be able to form more memories. Like clearing the deck of the
    previous day's learning os there's more space for the new.
  * 20% improvement in ability to memorize facts, after a nap
    * "The difference between the two groups at six p.m. was not small: a 20 percent learning advantage for
      those who slept."
  * Shallow NREM sleep contains electrical waves from the hippocampus (short-term memories) to the cortex,
    clearing out the hippocampus and committing that information to long-term storage.
  * Elderly (age 60-80) have a 40% deficit of sleep spindles in their shallow NREM sleep, and thus less
    capability to learn and remember factual information.
  * Sleep after learning performs memory consolidation, committing the new information.
  * After studying, sleep. Time awake before the exam accelerates forgetting.
  * The amount of deep NREM sleep is highly predictive of how much information from the day prior will be
    retained.
  * "Before having slept, participants were fetching memories from the short-term storage site of the
    hippocampus -- that temporary warehouse, which is a vulnerable place to live for any long duration of time
    if you are a new memory. But things looked very different by the next morning. The memories had moved.
    After the full night of sleep, participants were now retrieving that same information from the neocortex,
    which sits at the top of the brain -- a region that serves as the long-term storage site for fact-based
    memories, where they can now live safely, perhaps in perpetuity."
    * (This was discovered using MRI scans; cool).
  * "Even day-time naps as short as twenty minutes can offer a memory consolidation advantage, so long as they
    contain enough NREM sleep."
  * "It will even salvage those that appeared to have been lost soon after learning. In other words, following
    a night of sleep you regain access to memories that you could not retrieve before sleep."
  * Experiments show that reinforcing electrical voltage of NREM brainwaves, or playing audio chimes in time
    with those waves, improves memory consolidation by 40%. (Was this just in seniors, or in everyone?)
  * (I wonder if reduced retention ability is a feature of old age, not a bug. What if our cortex is full of
    valuable memories and we commit only the most useful facts during our late life sleep?)
  * Sleep to forget?
    * "[Forgetting] also lowers the brain resources required for retrieving those memories we want to retain."
    * "Sleep helps you retain everything you need and nothing that you don't, improving the ease of memory
      recollection."
    * (So is it wise to try to artificially increase how much information we retain during sleep, incurring
      the downside of diluting our brain's retrieval efficiency?)
  * In an experiment of daytime naps: "sleep powerfully, yet very selectively, boosted the retention of those
    words previously tagged for 'remembering,' yet actively avoided the strengthening of those memories tagged
    for 'forgetting.'"
    * Sleep is more intelligent/discriminating than we'd once imagined.
  * For motor skill memory, "practice, then sleep, makes perfect." This is probably why regularly-scheduled
    sessions, like piano lessons, spread across days, allows for the most progress.
    * "20 percent improvement in performance speed and 35 percent improvement in accuracy" of a new skill,
      after a night's sleep. Time awake does not produce this improvement.
    * "Their typing, post-sleep, was now fluid and unbroken. Gone was the staccato performance, replaced by
      seamless automaticity, which is the ultimate goal of motor learning."
  * During sleep, "rather than a transfer from short to long-term memory required for saving facts, the motor
    memories had been shifted over to brain circuits that operate below the level of consciousness. As a
    result, those skill actions were now instinctual habits. They flowed out of hte body with ease, rather
    than feeling effortful and deliberate."
  * The motor memory consolidation happens in stage 2 REM which is the most abundant during hours 6-8 of an 8
    hour sleep.
  * "We see a spike in stage 2 NREM sleep, including sleep spindles, right around the infant's time of
    transition from crawling to walking." (This is an intense period of motor skill development for the
    infant).
  * "Following a stroke, the brain begins to reconfigure those neural connections that remain, and sprout new
    connections around the damaged zone." Sleep aids this process.
* Too extreme for the Guinness Book of World Records: sleep deprivation and the brain (chap 7)
  * "People miserably under-predict their degree of performance disability due to sleep."
  * "Based on epidemiological studies of average sleep time, millions of individuals unwittingly spend years
    of their life in a sub-optimal state of psychological and physiological functioning, never maximizing
    their potential of mind or body due to their blind persistence in sleeping too little."
  * "Drink drivers are often late in braking, and late in making evasive maneuvers. But when you fall asleep,
    or have a microsleep, you stop reacting altogether." And this results in more deadly crashes.
  * Power naps temporarily stave off severe lapses in concentration, but for a short time, and to a limited
    degree.
  * Impulse and reward centers of the brain -- the stratum -- become hyperactive in response to rewards when
    the person is sleep deprived.
    * "The heightened sensitivity of these hedonic regions was linked to a loss of the rational control from
      the prefrontal context."
  * "Insufficient sleep during childhood significantly predicts early onset of drug and alcohol use in that
    same child during their later adolescent years, even when controlling for other high-risk traits, such as
    anxiety, attention deficits, and parental history of drug use."
  * In the movie Memento, "the part of his brain that was damaged was the hippocampus. It is the very same
    structure that sleep deprivation will attack, blocking your brain's capacity for new learning."
  * Cramming foran exam gives you only short-term recall
    * "Those few memories you are able to learn while sleep-deprived are forgotten far more quickly in the
      hours and days thereafter."
  * "If you don't sleep the very first night after learning, you lose the chance to consolidate those
    memories, even if you get lots of 'catch-up' sleep thereafter."
  * Alzheimer's results in amyloid plaque buildup in the brain, which erodes the area of the brain which
    coordinates NREM sleep. We know that less NREM inhibits the brain's ability to clear waste products like
    amyloid. Which causes which? It's unclear, but sleep disorders greatly increase the chance of Alzheimer's.
* Cancer, heart attacks, and a shorter life (chap 8)
  * "Every experiment that has investigated the impact of deficient sleep on the human body has observed an
    overactive sympathetic nervous system." I.e. stress is set to "on".
  * Being awake does not burn materially more calories than when asleep.
  * Sleep deprivation makes you feel more ravenous because satiety hormones are suppressed.
  * Also, you crave more snacks/munchies because there's less impulse control: the brain prefers high-calorie
      and sugary foods under sleep deprivation because the prefrontal cortex exhibits much less oversight of the
      cravings.
  * Sleep deprivation lowers testosterone in men by large amounts, as if they had aged by 10-15 years.
  * Experimental finding: when exposed to a cold virus, 5hr/night sleepers had 50% infection rate. 8hr/night
    had 18%.
  * When getting vaccines, being well-slept allows the body to produce 100% more antibodies than those who
    were poorly slept.
  * "A single night of four hours of sleep -- such as going to bed at three a.m. and waking up at seven a.m.
    -- swept away 70 percent of the natural killer cells circulating in the immune system, relative to a full
    eight-hour night of sleep." You become immediately prone to sickness.
* Dreaming as overnight therapy (chap 10)
  * The author conjectures that dreaming provides a form of therapy which removes the "emotional charge" of
    our most painful experiences.
    * (This has been proven experimentally: sleeping reduced emotional response upon recalling a disturbing
      image, but only after dream sleep.)
  * "Through its therapeutic work at night, REM sleep performed the elegant trick of divorcing the bitter
    emotional rind from the information-rich fruit. We can therefore learn and usefully recall salient life
    events without being crippled by the emotional baggage that those painful experiences originally carried."
  * "Her patients required REM sleep with dreaming, but dreaming of a very specific kind: that which expressly
    involved dreaming about the emotional themes and sentiments of the waking trauma. It was only that
    content-specific form of dreaming that was able to accomplish clinical remission and offer emotional
    closure in these patients."
  * PTSD patients cannot uncharge the traumatic memory, due to high levels of stress hormones, but the body
    keeps trying. This results in recurring nightmares. A drug can lower these stress levels, allowing the
    patient to dream normally, and this greatly relieves symptoms. (Amazing).
  * The ability to finely read the facial expressions of others diminishes from recent sleep loss. We can
    make foes out of our friends.
    * "Gone was the precise ability to read giveaway clues in another's face."
* Dream creativity and dream control (chap 11)
  * "Upon awakenings from NREM sleep, participants did not appear to be especially creative, solving few of
    the anagram puzzles. But it was a different story when I woke them up out of REM sleep, from the dreaming
    phase. Overall, problem-solving abilities rocketed up, with participants solving 15 to 35 percent more
    puzzles when emerging from REM sleep compared with awakenings from NREM sleep or during daytime waking
    performance!" (Neat)
  * Being awoken from NREM vs. REM sleep and being tested on memory association networks:
    * "Gone is the hierarchy of logical associative connection. The REM-sleep dreaming brain was utterly
      uninterested in bland, commonsense links -- the one-step-to-the-next associations. Instead, the
      REM-sleep brain was shortcutting the obvious links and favoring very distantly related concepts. The
      logic guards had left the REM-sleep dreaming brain."
    * Widening our mental aperture: "The brain becomes actively biased toward seeking out the most distant,
      nonobvious links between sets of information."
  * "Learning versus comprehension. REM sleep allows your brain to move beyond the former and truly grasp the
    latter."
  * "A problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it." -
    John Steinbeck
  * "Different from solidifying memories, which we now realize to be the job of NREM sleep, REM sleep, and the
    act of dreaming, takes that which we have learned in one experience setting and seeks to apply it to
    others stored in memory."
  * On Edison: maybe he slept less as he claimed, but he generously used daytime napping as a tool, calling it
    "the genius gap."
* Things that go bump in the night - sleep disorders (chap 12)
  * Insomnia patients at bedtime: the emotional centers in the brain do not ramp down normally
    * "Think of a time when you closed the lid of a laptop to put it to sleep, but came back later to find
      that the screen was still on, the cooling fans were still running, and the computer was still active,
      despite the closed lid."
* iPads, Factory Whistles, and Nightcaps - what's stopping you from sleeping? (chap 13)
  * "Compared to reading a printed book, reading on an iPad suppressed melatonin release by over 50 percent at
    night. Indeed, iPad reading delayed the rise of melatonin by up to three hours, relative to the natural
    rise in these same individuals when reading a printed book."
  * The brain is not done processing and committing learned knowledge after the first night of sleep:
    * "Memories remain perilously vulnerable to any disruption of sleep (including that from alcohol) even up
      to three nights after learning, despite two full nights of natural sleep prior."
  * "Your nocturnal melatonin levels are therefore controlled not only by the loss of daylight at dusk, but
    also the drop in temperature that coincides with the setting sun. Environmental light and temperature
    therefore synergistically, though independently, dictate nightly melatonin levels and sculpt the ideal
    timing of sleep."
  * (Splash water on your face before bed, to cool off?)
  * Unknowingly ejecting feet from the covers, to lower body temp:
    * "The limb rebellion aids in keeping the body core cool, allowing to fall and stay asleep."
  * "A bedroom temperature of around 65F is ideal for the sleep of most people, assuming standard
    bedding and clothing."
  * Cool result: using a thermally cooled body suit reduces time to fall asleep by 20%, and reduced the
    probability that subjects would wake up in the second half of the night from 58% to 4% (!).
  * Why hot baths help you fall asleep
    * "The hot bath invites blood to the surface of your skin, giving you that flushed appearance. When you
      get out of the bath, those dilated blood vessels on the surface quickly help radiate out inner heat, and
      your core body temperature plummets."
  * Alarm clock: "Participants artificially wrenched from sleep will suffer a spike in blood pressure and a
    shock acceleration in heart rate caused by an explosive burst of activity from the fight-or-flight branch
    of the nervous system."
* Hurting and helping your sleep - pills vs. therapy (chap 14)
  * Rather than sleep pills, which deliver a false, shallow sleep, the author recommends behavioral therapy
    where a therapist enforces good sleep hygiene and constrains sleep initially, to rebuild confidence
    against insomnia.
  * Do exercise at least 2 hours before bed
    * "Try not to exercise right before bed. Body temperature can remain high for an hour or two after
      physical exertion. Should this occur too close to bedtime, it can be difficult to drop your core
      temperature sufficiently to initiate sleep due to the exercise-driven increase in metabolic rate."
  * "For healthy sleep, the scientific evidence suggests that you should avoid going to bed too full or too
    hungry."
