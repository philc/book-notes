* To sleep (chap 1)
  * "Vehicular accidents caused by drowsy driving exceed thsoe caused by alcohol and drugs combined."
  * Sleep is clearly designed to be important. It is a bounty of ehalth benefits.
  * "Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day." It's
    yours for the taking.
* Caffeine, jet lag, and melatonin (chap 2)
  * Circadian rhythm, the "powerful sculpting force" around the day. It controls release of horrmones and your
    mood throughout the day.
  * When daylaightght is absent, the natural human circadian rhythm is 24.25 hours. For some mammals, it's
    less than 24hrs. The sunlight resets our imprecise internal clock.
  * "Whiel light is the most reliable and thus the primary zeitgeber (synchronizer), there are many factors
    that can be used in addition to, or in the absence of, daylight."
    * Even blind people have an accurate circadian rhythm.
  * The body's temperature fluctuates by 1/2 a degree throughout the day. The drop int emperature at night
    helps initiate sleep.
    * The body's temp fluctuates whether you actually sleep or not.
  * About circadian rhythms, "the respsective peak and trough points are strikingly different from one
    individual to the next."
  * "An adult's owlness or larkness, also known as their chronotype, is strongly determined by gnetics. If
    you are a night owl, it's likely that one (or both) of your parents is a night owl."
  * "Unfortunately, owls are more chronically sleep-depreived, having to wake up with the larks, but not being
    able to fall asleep until far later in the evening." Owls are thus often forced to burn the proverbial
    candle at both ends. Greater ill health caused by a lack of sleep therefore befalls owls, including higher
    rates of depression, anxiety, diabetes, cancer, heart attack, and stroke."
    * The owls are disadvantaged because the work place has standardized on the early lark schedule.
  * Melatonin
    * Melatonin is the hormone emitted by your brain to implement the circadian rhythm.
      * It ramps up at dusk and coordinates the timing of sleep to other brain regions.
    * Pace of jet lag adjustment
      * "It's a slow process. For every day you are in a different time zone, your suprachiasmatic nucleus can
        only readjust by about one hour. It therefore took me about eight days to readjust to London time after
        having been in San Francisco."
    * Traveling Westward is easier than eastward, because it's easier to stretch a day and stay up late than it
      is to shrink a day.
    * Flight crews do routinely make long haul flights. Disturbing.
      * "Parts of their brains -- specifically those related to learning an dmemory -- had physically shrunk,
        suggesting the destruction of brain cells caused by the biological stress of time-zone travel."
    * Take melatonin at 7pm in the new time zone to mimic the body's natural reaction to dusk, and signal that
      it will soon be time for sleep.
  * Adenosine is a hormone that builds up continuously and implements sleep pressure.
    * "Think of it as a chemical barometer that continuously regiseters the amount of elapsed time since you
      woke up this morning."
    * "High concentrations of adenosine simultaneously turn down the 'volume' of wake-promoting regions in the
      brain and turn up the dial on sleep-inducing regions."
    * Cafffeine mutes adenosine by occupying the neuroreceptors that adenosine targets.
    * Caffeine level peaks 30m after oral consumption. The half-life is six hours. Although genetics allow
      some people to have a more efficient enzyme which clears it in less than three hours.
    * Beware dark chocolate at night, because it contains caffeine.
    * Caffeine crash: the high contrast between complete wakefulness because of adenosine blockage, versus the
      high adenosine count once the caffeine wars off.
    * (Fun diagram of the effects of varoius drugs on spiderweb building. Caffeine produced the worst
      results).
  * Sleep pressure and circadian rhythm do not coordinate, but they are usually aligned.
  * "Sleep debt" comes from adenosine accumulation across nights, because the sleep each night wasn't long
    enough to clear all of the adenosine.
  * The target for a healthy sleep program is to wake up without the use of an alarm clock.
* Defining and generating sleep (chap 3)
  * During sleep, NREM (non-rapid eye movement) transitions to REM sleep every 90m.
  * The first half of the night is dominated by deep sleep, stages 3 and 4. The second half is by REM.
  * (The EKG spindles from brain activity in deep NREM sleep are incredible -- how can they be so slow and
    predictable / rhythmic? It's millions of brain cells somehow coordinating and firing in unison.)
  * The slow, synchronized waves of deep sleep are somehow transferring memroies from short to long term
    storage.
  * "REM sleep has also been called paradoxical sleep: a brain that appears awake, yet a body that is clearly
    asleep. It is often imposible to distinguish REM sleep from wakefulness using just electrical brainwave
    activity."
  * "Each and every night, REM sleep ushers you into a preposterous theater wherein you are treated to a
    bizarre, highly associative carnival of autobiographical themes."
  * "Mere seconds before the dreaming phase begins, and for as long as the REM-sleep period lasts, you are
    completely paralyzed. There is no tone in the voluntary muscles of your body. None whatsoever."
    * Your muscles maintain tone in NREM sleep.
* Ape beds, dinosaurs, and napping with half a brain (chap 4)
  * All animals stuided have some form of sleep, where they are passive and unresponsive to external stimuli,
    and when depreived, they seek to recuperate it.
  * Dolphins sleep in one brain hemisphere at a time.
  * Birds that group together in a flock will from a line; the middle of the flock sleeps with both halves of
    their brain. The end guards will sleep with only 1/2 of their rains, keeping one eye open.
    * Amazing: "At some point, the two end-guards will stand up, rotate 180 degrees, and sit back down,
      allowing the other side of their respective brains to enter deep sleep."
  * REM sleep is never done on just 1/2 the brain, while the other half is awake.
  * Argues that pre-industrial age peoples had biphasic sleep -- 7hrs at night and 1/hr nap during high heat.
    And "midnight" was actually the middle of the night for them.
  * Everyone experiences "post-prandial (i.e. meal) alertness dip" -- the afternoon slump -- that pressures
    sleep. For this reason, don't schedule your presentation mid-afternoon.
  * "From a prescription written long ago in our ancestral genetic code, the practice of natural biphasic
    sleep, and a healthy diet, appear to be the keys to a long-sustained life."
    * Argues that there's a measurable, decreased risk of heart disease in enclaves of Greece where siestas
      still happen. Why do kids stop napping? Would they take a siesta if they had less stimulation?
  * (There's a lot of wishful evolutionary speculation in this chapter)
  * Argues that our intensity of sleep, i.e. the proportion of REM sleep, is what enables us to be intelligent
    and socially complex, when compared to other animals.
  * The power of REM sleep for our species, when it's used for emotional processing:
    * "We humans can instantiate vast numbers of emotions in our embodied brains, and thereafter, deeply
      experience and even regulate those emotions. Moreover, we can recognize and help shape the emotions of
      others. Through both of these intra- and interpersonal processes, we can forge the types of cooperative
      alliances that are necessary to establish large social groups, and beyond groups, entire societies
      brimming with powerful structures and idealogies. What may at first blush have seemed like a modest
      asset awarded by REM sleep to a single individual is, I believe, one of the most valuable commodities
      ensuring the survival and dominance of our species as a collective."
  * On the value of creativity vs. the value of socail complexity
    * "Creativity is an evolutionary powerful tool, yes. But it is largely limited to an individual. Unless
      creative, ingenious solutions can be shared betwen individuals through the emotionally rich, pro-social
      bonds and cooperative relationships that REM sleep fosters -- then creativity is far more likely to
      remain fixed within an individual, rather than spread to the masses."
  * Summary of his view on the impact of sleep on human evolution: the breakout moment was learning to form
    large social groups.
    * "Our shift from tree to ground sleeping instigated an ever more bountiful amount of rleative REM sleep
      comparedw ith other primates, and from this bounty emerged a steep increase in cognitive creativity,
      emotional intelligence, and thus social complexity."
* Changes in sleep across the life sepan (chap 5)
  * Two weeks before birth, a baby doubles its consumption of REM sleep to 12 hours a day.
    * Possibly why: "The brain, like the roof of a house, is one of the last items to be constructed during
      development. And like a roof, there are sub-stages to that process -- you need a roof frame before you
      can start adding roof tiles."
    * "Dazzling bursts of electrical activity during REM sleep stimulate the lush growth of neural pathways."
  * On autism
    * "Imbalances in synpatic connections are common in autistic individuals: excecss amounts of connectivity
      in some parts of the brain, deficiencies in others." There's less hardware for social engagement.
    * The brain's uneven development when they're young may have a root cause in their sleep drive
      * "Biologically, it is as if the day and night are far less light and dark, respsecitively, for autistic
        individuals. As a consequences, there is a weaker signal for when stable wake and solid sleep should
        take place. Additionally, and perhaps related, the total amount of sleep that autistic children can
        generate is less than that of non-autistic children."
      * Autistic children consume 30-50% less REM sleep than regular children.
      * Initial read on the direction of causality here: "rats deprived of REM sleep during infancy go on to
        become socially withdrawn and isolated as adolescents and adults."
  * Alcohol suppresses REM sleep. Mothers who drink, even a glass in the first two weeks, noticeably inhibit
    the REM sleep of hte fetus. Same is true when drinking while breast feeding.
  * Alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been linked to autism.
  * "What emerges from all of those studies is that REM sleep is not optional during early human life, but
    obligatory. Every hour of REM sleep appears to count, as evidenced by the desperate attempt by a fetu sor
    newborn to regain any REM sleep when it is lost."
  * At birth, the NREM/REM ratio beings at 50/540, and throughout childhood, slowly transitions to 80/20.
  * Argues that brain pathway expansion is the priority early in life, and is done via REM. Pruning pathways,
    for efficiency, becomes the priority at puberty, and is done through NREM.
  * Good analogy of an ISP using use-dependent shaping of the network
    * "A use-reshaping and downsizing must still occur if maximum network efficiency is to be achieved."
  * A tree analogy of a brain's maturation through life
    * "A tree as it first comes into bud in the spring (babyhood), then bursts into leaf during the summer
      (late childhood), then matures in color come the fall (early adolescence), and finally sheds its leave
      in the winter (late adolescence and early adulthood)."
  * "The ability to learn, retain, and thus remember new memories persists, even when set against the backdrop
    of general connectivity down-scaling throughout late development. Nevertheless, by teenage years, the
    brain is less malleable, or plastic, than during infancy or early childhood -- one example being the ease
    with which younger childrenc an pick up a second language comparedw ith older adolescents."
  * Children have a circadian rhythm that runs earlier than teens and adults, which prevents them from
    indulging in late nights.
  * Teens have later circadian rhythms than even adults, which makes early school start times tragic for their
    sleep health.
  * Older adults need as much sleep as always, but can't generate as much sleep drive as they age.
  * In your 40s, the deep NREM brainwaves are less deep and less powerful -- 60% less so than when we were
    teens.
  * Older adults have weakened bladders adn thus more fragmented sleep, and less efficient time in bed. To
    mitigate this, drink less before bed.
  * In seniors, dozing off on the couch because you stayed up toolate given the shifting circadian rhythm, is
    in fact a nap which reduces adenosine sleep pressure when you awake in your chair, decreasing sleep
    efficiency from then on.
  * If you want to shift your rhythm to later, get sunlight late in the day to promote melatoni and
    wakefulness, or take melatonin supplements.
  * "The parts of our brain that ignite healthy deep sleep at night are the very same araes that degenerate,
    or atrophy, earliest and most severely as we age."
